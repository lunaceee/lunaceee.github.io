<p>After three months of frenzied work in the shop, we’re happy to announce that all of our new products for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus - cases, bumpers, and wood and leather cases - have moved into production mode. As the year comes to a close, we’re running double shifts on the mills and have all hands on deck in order to get your orders finished and shipped as soon as possible. We know it’s been a long haul since the newest iPhone dropped and we’re incredibly grateful for both your support and patience!</p><p><img src="/media/redactor/ip6-folio-detail-dec2014-A1.jpg"></p><p>Here is our latest:</p><h4>The Wood &amp; Leather iPhone 6 Plus Case</h4><p>Our most ambitious and technically challenging case of the six, we’re ecstatic that work has begun on them. </p><h4>Wood:</h4><p>In the past few weeks, our design engineer has machined the aluminum fixtures and lasered the custom clamps that will hold the frame profiles during CNC milling.</p><p>The Mastercam program for the frames have also been completed and the wooden frame prototypes have been milled and approved. </p><p>Lean batches are now being constructed, standards of work hammered out, and the finishing touches applied to each piece.</p><p><img src="/media/redactor/13099648743_09d6b69264_k.jpg"></p><h4>&amp; Leather:</h4><p>The cover is composed of a single piece of premium leather and is cut to size using our precision laser cutters. </p><p>For a sturdy yet flexible cover, kerfing (a set of small incisions) was etched into the interior of the cover.

<p>With winter knocking on the door, we are thrilled to report that we have moved into full-scale production for bumpers and cases for iPhone 6! However, with this milestone met, it is not yet time to rest as we race to bring our wooden and leather folio case for iPhone 6 to the production stage. All aspects of the folio have been greenlit by our creative director and we have initialized the first test batches of this awesome product. We believe these products are our best yet and we can’t wait to get them finished and onto your phones!</p><p><img src="/media/redactor/ip6-walnut-leather-A1.jpg"></p><h4>The Wood and Leather Case Production</h4><p>The wood and leather case frame features a slightly different design than that found in the bumper and case. To accommodate the cover without compromising the frame’s strength, an alternating joint pattern was incorporated. The cover’s spine also features a squared edge. </p><p>The first batches of frame profiles have been lasercut, assembled, and passed to our milling crew to be CNC'd. With the fine details cut, the frames are then finished by our handwork team, who smooth out the rough finishes leftover by machining, and apply a natural oil that enhances the richness of the wood. After 24-hours on the drying rack, the frames are ready for the covers. Once the oil has dried, the frames are ready for the addition of the leather cover and a final fit test before being sent to our finished goods department for shipping.</p><p><br>With our initial test runs finished, we are nearly ready to move into full production of the Wood &amp; Leather iPhone Case!</p><p><img src="/media/redactor/DSCF8190.JPG"></p><h4>iPhone 6 Plus Case Production Started</h4><p>The slightly larger size of the iPhone 6 Plus required a slightly modified design of the bumper and backplate. The manufacturing of the 6 Plus is very similar to that of the 6, and we are ready to begin production on the cases for the 6 Plus.</p><h4>Now Shipping iPhone 6 Bumpers &amp; Cases</h4><p>In the past couple of weeks, we have moved from small batch to full-scale production of bumpers and cases for iPhone 6. We have also optimized our production process in order to up our product output while retaining our usual high standards of workmanship and quality. Each day has seen an increased number of bumpers and cases being completed and passed to our finished goods department for shipping!</p><p><img src="/media/redactor/ip6-walnut-prototype-F1.jpg"></p><h4>What’s Next?</h4><p>We are entering December with all of our products for iPhone 6 having moved from the initial testing phases into full-scale production. As far as the rest of the year goes, we’ve got nothing on our minds but getting your orders finished as quickly as possible.</p><p>Thanks again for your continued support and patience!&nbsp;</p>

PRODUCTION BEGINS
</h2>
<h4>
NOVEMBER 18, 2014
</h4>
<p>November has arrived and with it the very first batches of cases and bumpers for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus! The past month has been a mad dash that has seen numerous redesigns, adjustments and late nights in the workshop in order to get these products to the manufacturing stage. We believe these products are our best yet and we cannot wait to get them finished and onto your phones!</p><p><img src="/media/redactor/ip6-walnut-prototype-L1.jpg"></p><h4><strong>The Wood and Leather Case for iPhone 6</strong></h4><ul>
<li>Prototypes of the folio frame have been tested for fit, functionality, and durability. We discovered that insertion of the phone works best when put in from the right side of the case.</li><li>To increase the strength of the folio, we left more material to the squared edges of the case. To reinforce a weak point where the toggle switch is located, we widened the left side of the frame.</li><li>We also optimized access to the iPhone’s jacks and ports - the size of the case’s apertures have been increased without sacrificing strength.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><img src="/media/redactor/folio%20regen%20screencap%20(1).JPG"></p><ul>
<li>Our creative director approved design of the folio’s leather cover after the submission of numerous prototypes.</li><li>To ensure the folio stays in landscape (upright) position, we adjusted the articulation of the cover. Lasercut flex points were added for increased pliancy of the cover.</li><li>We also evaluated the adhesive attachment’s durability once it is affixed to the folio frame.</li></ul><p><img src="/media/redactor/ip6-folio-prototype-A1%20(1).jpg"></p>

<h4><strong></strong><strong>Production of iPhone 6 Case and Bumper:</strong></h4><p><br>The initial frame profiles are lasercut from solid maple and walnut. The frame profiles are then assembled by hand using our custom developed tools and manufacturing processes.</p><p><img src="/media/redactor/IMG_7358Captureone.jpg"></p><ul><li>Once assembly is completed, the frames are passed to our CNC mill operator for machining. Inside the mill, the frames are stationed in our custom fixtures. Carbide cutters machine the wood to tolerances of .001”.</li><li>We found that the oscillations of the mill agitated the fixtures that grasp the case. Additionally, the rounded design of the case contributed to the case wobbling in the fixture during milling.</li><li>Once the initial case runs were out of the mill, we saw that the chamfers (the angled cuts that taper into the sides of the cases) were uneven. To ameliorate these irregularities, the CNC offsets were adjusted.</li></ul><p><img src="/media/redactor/IMG_7222Captureone.jpg"></p><ul><li>High kill rates were also recorded at the headphone jack aperture location. The case failed while attempting to accommodate 3rd party connectors. Our cases comply with Apple OEM plugs, yet we had hoped to meet requests to fit larger plugs. However, the bridge was weakened due to the loss of material when we increased the aperture size (see below left).</li></ul><p><img src="/media/redactor/ip6-walnut-prototype-C1.jpg"></p><ul><li>With our test runs completed and standards of work laid out, the handwork team has begun limited production of bumpers.

These gaps occurred due to the hand sanding applied to the machined materials, thus making each one slightly different in dimension.&nbsp;</span>To solve this issue, we redesigned the backplate to slightly overlap the case frame in order to prevent gaps (pictured below).</li></ul><p><img src="/media/redactor/i6-plate-compare-A2.png"></p><ul><li>Additionally, the standards of work were refined to ensure an exact fit of the backplate and frame.</li></ul><p><img src="/media/redactor/ip6-walnut-prototype-D1.jpg"></p><p>With goals met for our cases and bumpers, we have momentum on our side as we tackle the final piece in our trio of products for iPhone 6. Being on schedule means that our cases and bumpers have been sent to our finished goods department.</p><p>The design and manufacture of new products can be a very challenging process. We do it as it allows us to continuously improve our products, even as we transition them into the production phase.

<h2>
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PART 1
</h2>
<h4>
OCTOBER 20, 2014
</h4>
<p>
Over the past several weeks, we’ve met design milestones and attacked challenges. Our designers and production engineers have been putting in extra hours, staying late and working over the weekends to hasten our march towards production. We know you’re curious as to what we’ve been up to lately. Here’s an update<img src="/media/redactor/ip6-walnut-crop-D1.jpg" style="background-color: initial;"></p><ul>
<li>Fabrication of fixtures for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus cases was completed. These fixtures are custom tools we make that hold tightly onto our parts while the CNC cuts them. The curved surfaces of the case proved very challenging to grab a hold of. Creative solutions were found after much experimentation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The positioning of the iPhone camera is closer to the edge than anticipated causing problems with the backplate design. We widened the backplate to ensure a strong bridge without losing aesthetic features. We also added 3D surfacing on the inside, adding an extra operation that doubles our machine time while strengthening weak areas and ensuring a snug fit.</li></ul><p>
<img src="/media/redactor/ip6-walnut-prototype-B1_1.jpg"></p><ul>
<li>Modified design of case frame to accommodate reshaping of backplate. Design was changed so that profile matches that of the iPhone’s sides.</li></ul><ul>
<li>With all case component fixtures completed and in place, machining of case prototype ensued. After stress testing, we found that overall durability of the case was not up to our standards. </li></ul><ul>
<li>In order to successfully troubleshoot material shortcomings, we looked back to the drawing board. Below are 3 cross sections demonstrating our process. Our first try (Detail Y) was too weak because of the curved profile of the iPhone 6. We know our iPhone 5 bumper (Detail V) is strong enough so we used that cross section area as a reference to create a new profile (Detail AA) that adds strength while minimizing visual bulk.
<p>
<img src="/media/redactor/ip6-comparison-A1.png">
</p></li></ul><ul>
<li>We also detected issues with the strength of the glue employed for the joints. Trials were run with different adhesives, joint designs, and clamping methods to find the best combination for our corner joints. We found a solution up to our standards. Yes!</li></ul><ul>
<li>The redesigned frame required re-fabrication of the fixtures, a step back. Now, successful prototypes have been made with all of the included tweaks and&nbsp;adjustments and they look great! Final pre-production prep has begun with the creation and testing of custom actuated wooden buttons.</li></ul><p>
<img src="/media/redactor/ip6-walnut-prototype-A2_1.jpg"></p><p>
It’s been one month since Apple released iPhone 6 and we’re where we want to be with our development schedule. The obstacles we have faced so far are completely normal and a standard part of the process of getting new products designed and ready for manufacturing. We have been around since 2009, with successful cases made for iPhone 3, 4, and 5. With our experience and technical expertise and abilities, we are well equipped to both design and fabricate great iPhone 6 products for you and are grateful for the opportunity. Thanks for your patience!</p><p>
<img src="/media/redactor/iPhone%206%20Phase%201%20Still%20Life4358Captureonecrop.jpg"></p><p>
<img src="/media/redactor/ip6-walnut-crop-A1_1.jpg"></p><p>
How this works:</p><ul>
<li>We will develop the iPhone 6 products as fast as we can without compromising quality. </li>
<li>We will keep you in the loop with regular email updates. </li>
<li><strong>We will not be giving out shipping estimates at this time</strong> because we are too early in the production process. There are too many unknown variables that could lead to setbacks and delays. We know better ;)</li></ul><p>
Thank you for your patience everyone! We’re feeling great about iPhone 6 and hope you are too!</p>

WHEN ARE YOU SHIPPING?
</h2>
<h4>
OCTOBER 09, 2014
</h4>
<p>Our iPhone 6 products are designed to fit perfectly. We don’t build on assumptions and with Apple’s keeping everything - aspect, dimension, proportion - about their newest product a closely guarded secret, we can’t start setting up for manufacturing until we have the phones in hand.</p><p>Grovemade is completely committed to finishing our new line of products for iPhone 6 and getting them onto your phone as quickly as possible. <strong>Being in the earliest stages of our production process, we’re unable to give shipping estimates at this time. </strong>There are too many unknown variables that could lead to setbacks and delays. We’re not into making promises we can’t keep and if we can’t guarantee it, we can’t get behind it. What we can guarantee is a product of unmatched quality and distinction.</p>
</div>
<div class="i6-content">
<h2>
GETTING STARTED
</h2>
<h4>
SEPTEMBER 26, 2014
</h4>
<p>
September 12: We finally are able to download the specs from Apple's website and immediately began applying them to our 3D CAD mock-ups. Prototype production followed soon afterward. Apple does not give specs out ahead of time to us or anyone else.</p><p>
September 19: Apple begins selling iPhone 6 in the flesh. Just as you did, we went to the Apple store, stood in line, picked up the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Back at the shop, we fitted them into our prototypes and began making the proper adjustments to ensure a perfect fit.&nbsp;</p><p>
Whats Next?</p><ul>
<li>Build fixtures for CNC Machining. Fixtures are custom made to hold our products’ component parts in our CNCs. </li>
