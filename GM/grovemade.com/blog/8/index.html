Yep, It’s True: Even CNN Loves Grove!
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
CNN loves Grove! &nbsp;Yes, they do!
Recently, Grove fans, you may have noticed that we were featured on CNN Money. Jose Pagliery posted a step-by-step
series of ten photographs and captions to help illustrate Grove’s
elaborate and old-fashioned design and production process for the new iPad case.
He was intrigued by our small local company of “youngsters” who really
are working from the ground up - from sketching out designs to piecing together our cases with lots of personal attention and finishing touches. &nbsp;
Even though the article centers on how we create and make our cases, this is the first major article that focuses on Grove
as a company rather than putting the spotlight on our wonderful
products. &nbsp;We hope it gives you all, patient customers and fans, a
little glimpse into our emphasis on hand craftsmanship, and perhaps a
bit more understanding behind our lead times (which we’re always
improving, of course)!
Grove on!

Sakura: Cherry Blossoms and the Beginning of Spring
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
It’s
April in Portland, which means the cherry blossoms are in bloom and
excitement is in the air for the warm, sunny days to come! Portland’s Governor Tom McCall Waterfront Park,
home to one hundred ornamental cherry trees, separates downtown from
the west bank of the Willamette River. The trees’ pink bloomage gives
Portland the perfect pick-me-up during the last stretch of overcast
winter.
Portland’s tie to its sister city Sapporo Japan is especially potent this time of year. This connection is celebrated with The Friendship Circle memorial at the north end of the Park (the memorial includes two 20-foot stainless steel towers that generate electronic tones!). The Japanese American Historical Plaza
is located south of the cherry trees and is dedicated to Japanese
immigrants and US-born citizens of Japanese descent who were deported to
inland internment camps during World War II.
Ken
Tomita, one of Grove’s co-founders, and Yuji, his brother and Grove’s
web engineer, are both Japanese-American. They were raised here in
Portland by their mother, Machiko Tomita, who helped them maintain a
strong connection with their Japanese culture and language. (Machiko is
also a part of Grove, hand-oiling cases with care!) Ken makes sure the
Grove team makes it down to “hanami” at Waterfront Park each spring,
which is the important tradition of picnicking, singing songs, and
drinking sake under the blossoms.
In
Japan, cherry blossoms can symbolize the ephemeral nature of life -
extreme beauty, transience, and mortality. These are interesting ideas
to think about during Spring’s new beginnings and sunny adventures.

Introducing a Very Special Employee: Ginger!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We’d
like to introduce an integral member of our team, Ginger! She’s the
iPad&nbsp;Master, the Queen of the Bamboo Backs, and
we’re lucky to have her with us.
Ginger
aka Danger Pennsylvania aka “Gingembre”, hails from central PA. She’s a
dedicated sun worshipper and devoted motivator (some might say
mastermind) of all outdoor activities. Her closet is brimming over with
Springtime games like badminton, a glow-in-the-dark frisbee, and the
ever-dangerous lawn darts!
Last month marked her one-year anniversary at Grove which she celebrated by playing kickball with mascot Sam 2 in the street.
Important
facts about Ginger: She’s a cyclist who eats cheese like it’s candy,
rocks Swayze Crazy Patrick Swayze Night with her buddy Aaron, and knows
the real deal about Paul Newman. Also, her beau has a dashing golden
mane, and above all she loves summer evenings and grilling on the porch.
In the shop, she keep things smart and upbeat with talkies, like Radiolab&nbsp;and Stuff You Should Know. She also rocks out to Loretta Lynn, Bob Dylan, and local Portland
bands like Run On Sentence and Sean Flynn and the Royal We.
The
backstory: Back in the olden times, Ginger was the barista who made
Grove founders Ken and Joe the coffee that fueled their iPhone case dreams. This was back in the day when Ken’s woodshop was still
in a humble dungeon below a coffee shop, and Joe was engraving out of
his bedroom.
Way
back when, she worked for the infamously well dressed woodworker,
George, and slowly began to help Ken and Joe out in their shop when
Grove was just a baby company. The rest is history!
Currently, she is scheming to construct a piñata of an enormous wiener dog. Good luck with your endeavor, Ginger!

Grove Loves The Portland Trail Blazers!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Last Thursday marked the first company wide Grove outing to watch a professional basketball game! &nbsp;
After work, we put down our custom iPad cases,
turned off our computers, and enjoyed a sunset walk to the Rose Garden
stadium to watch the Portland Blazers play the Memphis Grizzlies. &nbsp;It
was a great game, and the Blazers won, with a final score of 97-93!
Our
empathy goes out to our friends and fans who were rooting for the
Memphis Grizzlies. The game was neck and neck all night, and the
Grizzlies put up a great fight! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Highlights
included donning our Blazer’s gear and seeing Grove mascot Sam 2 make it onto the court for a dunk (I Spy Sam 2 in the group photo at the top of the post). Our favorite comment was from one particular Grover, less
accustomed to the ways of basketball, when they asked, “So, the man with
the orange circle is rewarded when he places it in the net ring?” &nbsp;Yep,
that about sums it up!
Team Grove had an exciting night out, and we’re looking forward to the next one. &nbsp;goGrove!

Grove Artist Spotlight: Nando Costa
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Originally from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Nando Costa
is a prolific illustrator, animator, and graphic artist living in our
fair city of Portland, OR. Nando serves as a director for the design and
live-action production firm Süperfad, and has been exploring the frontier of laser engraving in art. Nando’s art is featured on our Cellular Interference iPhone 4/4s Case and Leather Back.
Since he was 15, Nando has been dedicated to illustration. His education at Rio’s Parque Lage
and his relationships with the creative people close to him served as
strong inspirations during his time as a young artist. Since 1997, Nando
has worked with several unique design firms, including Sphaera Design
(Rio), WDDG (New York), Iconologic (Atlanta), Digital Kitchen (Chicago),
and Modernista! (Boston).
Nando founded Nakd.tv with his talented wife, Linn, in Brazil, as well as Nervo.tv here in Portland, which merged with Bent Image Lab in 2009 to create such works as the “Whale Song”
music video for Modest Mouse. His dynamic, versatile illustrations,
graphic designs, and animations have also been utilized by Absolut,
Adobe, Apple, Cartoon Network, Coca-Cola, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Lexus,
Microsoft, MTV, Nike, Nintendo, Samsung, Showtime, Timex, and Zune among
others.
We’re
so thrilled and honored to work with amazing creators like Nando. Stay
updated on his current laser engraved animation project, “The New America,” an animated short film with each frame engraved in wood! And don’t forget to visit his website here!

The Latest Evolution of Grove’s DIY Website
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Here at Grove, we not only do it all ourselves when it comes to our products, but also with our website. Thanks to our amazing web engineer, Yuji Tomita,
a self-described Energizer Bunny, we have seen constant improvements.
Our entire Grovemade.com web wonderland, front-end (what the customer
sees) and back-end (what we see behind the scenes) was imagined and
created with pride by our team.
As
Yuji put it, “The needs for every business are so unique that we've
gained a certain efficiency by building it all ourselves instead of
parting it out to 10 vendors and integrating solutions that were never
meant to coexist.” Just as Ken and Joe were developing the business from
scratch, Yuji was teaching himself to program based on what needed to
get done online. That’s right, he’s a self-taught mastermind - but
that’s a whole other story.
A
day came when Grove had so many orders they could not be sorted through
by hand, and that’s when our site was born from the framework of Shopify’s
shopping cart solution. Our site is run in Django, which means it’s
fast, powerful, and much sexier than a PHP site (it’s a fact). &nbsp;Django
is an open source project Yuji regularly supports, because he believes
in the free sharing of knowledge. We wanted to build our site just the
way we’d like it from the ground up, and it couldn’t have been done
without Yuji and Max Brown, our lead graphic designer.
Max
is the mastermind of styling and illustrating the site, with art
direction by Joe. You may have noticed that, page by page, the design of
our website has evolved continually since day one. Take a look at some
of the before and after photos!
Max’s
main goal with the re-design - the “fundamental leap” - is to simplify
the site and make it more organic in feel and appearance. We want the
site to be easy to use, requiring fewer clicks to get where you want to
go. The color scheme largely reflects the vibe and mood of our products,
and we’re taking the site in a direction that further reflects our partnership with our artists. Taupes, creams, and oranges have stepped in where greys and greens used to lie. Max says it’s a less Matrix-y feel, in other words, “Free your mind!”.
Stay tuned everyone and thank you so much for taking the time to read some technical bits of the Grove Story!
Remember to check out Yuji’s site here and Max’s site here!

Artist Spotlight: Flavio Melchiorre
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Flavio, the Italian artist and founder of IDRO51 Creative Design Studio, masterfully displays his trademark “hypnotic art” on a variety of mediums. You can find his art&nbsp;on bicycles,&nbsp;car roofs, print, paintings, and even on our Grove “Wild Things” iPhone 4/4S case. &nbsp;
His colorful patterns both
draw the eyes in to the artwork and simultaneously out over the edges
of the whole piece, where the viewer feels the designs extend - one
feels as if what’s being shown is only a small portion of
a larger picture. &nbsp;It’s impossible to tell where the overlapping loops
and squiggles begin; his fractal-like designs convey motion and depth as
the shapes seems to evolve and interact with one another. His artwork
is not chaotic, however - it instead feels balanced and abounding with
energy and life that’s expressive of the artist’s own “madness” as he
calls it. “I like to create a visual harmony using many colors together, each element develops in something more complex.”

Wool Felt iPad Sleeve
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Oh goody! Here comes our next new Grove product, and it’s mighty fine! Compatible with first, second, and third-generation iPads, our iPad Sleeve is a fashionable addition to our new product line inspired by Apple’s latest release.
The Wool Felt iPad Sleeve is a protective yet stylish sheath for your iPad made with our natural bamboo veneer and thick premium wool felt imported from Germany. Available in charcoal or sandstone, the sleeve is a great option if you’re concerned with protecting your iPad but still want to enjoy it’s slim feel while using it.
Our sleeve doesn’t mind sharing the spotlight; it’s great for use along with&nbsp;the Apple Smart Cover. While the Grove iPad 3 Case&nbsp;and most others aren’t likely to fit in the sleeve, your case may fit if it is exceptionally thin. Since we hate to disappoint, our suggestion is to assume the sleeve cannot be used with a case.
Along with sheer beauty, ease-of-use is an important benefit of this chic clutch. The iPad is kept secure with a snappy magnetic closure easily opened or closed with one hand.&nbsp;The solid design of our sturdy felt and bamboo veneer allows the sleeve to make a strong statement without any floppin’ around. We mold the bamboo veneer to the shape of the iPad and sew both materials together using special techniques that ensure a smooth feel for our customers.
As is the Grove way, the sleeve also comes with the bragging rights of supporting an ethically produced product made by hand here in Portland. Please beware that if you go with this sleeve, people will probably invade your personal space to reach for the silky, hand-oiled bamboo and pleasantly textured wool. Go ahead and soak up the attention. Or, hide. It’s your choice.
The Wool Felt iPad Sleeve will be priced at $99, with a limited-time introductory price of $79 through the end of March. We think you’re gonna love it!

&#34;The Month From Health&#34;
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Who’s ready for an onslaught of healthy living? &nbsp;
Team
Grove has declared March as “The Month From Health”, and we’re pulling
out all the stops. &nbsp;What started as one lad’s simple wish to eat better,
has spiraled into a company wide, no holds barred, face full of HEALTH!
&nbsp;
“It’s
all about breaking old habits, and replacing them with something
positive,” said Ginger G, woodshopper extraordinaire. &nbsp;“Hopefully it will change
into a regular routine by the end of the month.” &nbsp;&nbsp;
By checking in with each other daily, we are helping one another reach our own personal goals.
&nbsp;
Wholesome
highlights include: a raw food cleanse, daily yoga classes, walking to
work, nutritious breakfasts, morning chin ups, homegrown alfalfa
sprouts, working out at the gym, organic apple cider vinegar drinks,
evening jogs, Ken’s cilantro juice fast, and of course, bikes! &nbsp;goGrove!
What healthy practice will you pick up this month? &nbsp;Let us know!

&nbsp;
If you’re a&nbsp;Grove&nbsp;fan, you probably know our co-founders&nbsp;Ken and Joe. But if you don’t, come meet them!&nbsp;Digital Trends, an online resource with easy-to-read reviews of trendsetting consumer products, posted an article covering the&nbsp;10 necessities that our two cofounders can’t live without. Written by Kelly Montgomery, the post mentions a myriad of items, from a rainproof Nau jacket that allows Oregonians to comfortably commute on bike to a MacBook Air with its portable sleek design and reliability.
It also provides a glimpse into the&nbsp;Apple-centric and outdoorsy Pacific Northwest world of Grove’s cofounders, culture, and&nbsp;products. Their choices really shed light on what Joe and Ken value and how their unique personalities came together to form Grove.
“...Tomita had experience with custom-designed wood furniture, and Mansfield had previously worked engraving laptops, laptop cases, and leather covers for Moleskine notebooks. Now they run a successful small company (where everything is done in-house) that focuses on design, quality, and customer satisfaction.”
Thanks, Digital Trends! We hope to keep you buzzing with our newly released product lines!

What surprises Apple had in store for us on the &#34;iPad 3&#34;
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Yesterday Apple announced their latest and greatest 3rd generation iPad. Our development crew eagerly watched the live stream from engadget.com as the drama of the product launch unfolded. &nbsp;As case makers, what really matters to us is the external shape, not hardware and software upgrades. The rumor mill was mostly correct on new features headlined by the retina display, 5 megapixel camera w 1080p HD video and 4G LTE capability so no drama there. &nbsp;&nbsp;
“Say the name already!”, one of us screamed as Tim Cook and other VPs continued to ramble on about software and technical specs. There was much speculation over what the new iPad would be called in the weeks leading up to the announcement. Most referred to it as the “iPad 3” while a few days before rumors started spreading that it would called “iPad HD”. Finally, an hour and a half later the press conference ends with Apple simply referring to it as “the new iPad”.
Our team was prepared to launch our new case but we needed to know what to call our product before we could officially put it online. &nbsp;“The new iPad case”? That is not gonna cut it as the name of our product. Apple always gets us with a curveball somehow everytime. &nbsp;Last time it was the magnets and smart cover. This time, the name is where they really surprised us all! &nbsp;

Say Hello to the Grove iPad Case for the iPad 3 errrr.... &#34;new iPad&#34;
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
This is the first of our 3 product releases for the brand new iPad, announced today by Apple.&nbsp;
Sound the alarms and get ready to show off the head-turning Grove iPad Case for the new 3rd generation iPad. &nbsp;Surrounding the big reveal of the new iPad specifications, our design team has been working around the clock to create a case for the product building off the popular aesthetic of our iPad 2 Case. Eye-catching design, functionality, and natural materials come together in this tight ensemble crafted in our Portland workshop.
In addition to our all-natural vegetable-tanned leather, we’re excited to offer a new variation of our case. Our luxurious wool felt imported from Germany is a great accent to the bamboo shell of the case and a perfect alternative for those who choose not to use leather products.
In listening to your feedback about our iPad 2 case, we’ve made a design improvement we think you’ll love: the new single panel leather cover is now permanently attached to the bamboo shell, making it work great on your lap in landscape mode. This offers a more convenient experience and can easily be folded flat against the back of the case for optimal functionality, also putting the new iPad to sleep automatically when not in use.
We’re thrilled with the visual result of our newest case, but we’ll let you be the judge:
In terms of functionality, the bamboo shell&nbsp;is incredibly secure; the new iPad won’t slip out of the case no matter how hard you dance while holding it (we dance pretty hard around here) with our special over-hang design.
Our all-natural, vegetable-tanned leather has the same wonderful feel as our iPhone Leather Backs &nbsp;released last week. For the leather option, choose from plain, Artist Series,&nbsp;or a custom&nbsp;image of your choice if you really want to make your friends jealous. &nbsp;
The new iPad Case&nbsp;is priced at $139 for wool felt, $139 for plain leather, $149 for Artist Series Leather, and $179 for custom engraved leather. Place your order by March 31st, and we will offer a $20 discount to celebrate the launch of iPad 3!
Yeah, we’re pretty excited over here.
Have further questions? Reach out on our Facebook wall&nbsp;and we’ll get back to you in no time.&nbsp;Stay tuned next week for our next all-natural accessory for Apple’s latest release!
**UPDATE 3/8. &nbsp;We do not know if our new case will fit the iPad 2 until we get our hands on the new iPad and finalize the fit. &nbsp;For now, please assume only the new iPad (3rd gen) will fit. &nbsp;Please stay tuned!**

Welcome to Grove, Ariella!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We’d like to introduce the newest member to Team Grove, Ariella! &nbsp;Earlier this month, she started her position as a production assistant, and is already sanding her heart out and sewing the leather covers on our iPad cases with gusto.&nbsp;
Ariella aka “The Songbird” aka REI aka “Sticky Fingers”, hails from the piney meadows of Limerick, ME, a quaint hamlet nestled in the Northeast’s most cherished state. &nbsp;Recently, she graduated from Reed College with a Bachelors of Art in Anthropology, and wrote her thesis on “Human Zoos”. &nbsp;
Already, she’s known around the wood shop for her good humor, enthusiastic spirit, and bursting into cheerful song at a moments notice. She appreciates the relaxed atmosphere in the workshop, as well as the emphasis on making the Grove community a healthy environment to work in. We here at Grove are very deliberate about our company growth, and strive to maintain a positive culture in the workplace!
Important facts you should know about Ariella: She took karate for 8 years, and is ready to kick some tushy if you badmouth Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. &nbsp;She’s a bloody Mary enthusiast, a French macaroon lover, and owns a notorious cat, Moxie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She’s also been singing her entire life, and has been performing her unique blend of R&amp;B, funk, and folk, for seven years. &nbsp;Her band is called “SlowClap AfroNation”, and you can peep them here on Sound Cloud.
We welcome Ariella to our community with open arms, as Grove enters a vibrant expansion stage. &nbsp;As she said on her first day of work, “We’re halfway there, livin’ on a prayer!” &nbsp;Indeed... go Grove!

All About Mike Schultz, Grove’s Studly New Production Assistant
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Mike “Schultzy” Schultz is one of the newest additions to Team Grove! He is a proud founding member of the Grove dance squad, The Meryl Streeps, for which he moonwalks and carries a bike chain. &nbsp;His daytime cover is a production assistant who diligently sands down iPhone and iPad bamboo cases, but don’t be surprised if you hear loud laughter over the sound of CNC lasers and rough sandpaper! &nbsp;The wood shop crew definitely loves to keep each other laughing - good humor is a prerequisite! &nbsp;
Mike was drawn to Grove because he feels that “[Grove] takes care of its employees, and is engaging in deliberate slow growth to preserve its culture. &nbsp;I like to work for small, people-powered companies!”.
Mike hails from Ithaca, New York but is most recently joining us from a 15-month stint overseas along the Thai-Burma border. &nbsp;He was instrumental in developing a fully functioning arts and crafts studio in Mae Sot, Thailand called The Puzzlebox Art Studio, where his passion for art as an oil painter naturally lent itself to teaching foundations drawing and design to the Burmese migrant youth. Be sure to check out Mike’s stunning collection of art!
Mike is now back in Portland with his lovely partner Elizabeth and their insane kitten, Little Nova. He also enjoys healthy living, which means bicycling to work - as does 80% of the Grove team (I’m guesstimating!) - and growing tasty sprouts in his kitchen for himself and his lady. &nbsp;
Welcome home, Schultzy!

Five Bold iPad 3 Predictions
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Since the iPad 3 is expected to hit the markets soon, here’s a run-down of some of the rumors that have been circulating about the highly anticipated hardware:
The iPad 3 will be announced next Wednesday, March 7 and will feature a quad-core processor and 4G LTE chipset technology.
According to some credible Apple-devoted websites, the iPad 3 is due to be unveiled in the beginning of March (in other words, really, really, really, really soon)! The new iPad is said to feature a quad-core A6 processor, 2048×1536 “Retina” display (also featured in the iPhone 4), and 4G LTE chipset technology.
More on this rumor from TUAW, MacRumors, and Cult of Mac:
http://aol.it/x4RGEu
http://bit.ly/A2lscH
http://bit.ly/wZTZ1n
The body of the iPad 3 will be slightly thicker with a tapering bottom, accommodating a new 8 megapixel camera.
The iPad 3 will have some real curves - it ain’t no size-zero prototype model! According to TUAW (The Unofficial Apple Weblog), the iPad 3 will have a body about about 1 to 1.5 mm thicker up top with a tapering bottom. The alleged increase in thickness fuels rumors about a possible 8 megapixel back camera on the device. &nbsp;
More on this rumor:
http://aol.it/wU68Ip
http://bit.ly/w5YJY1
The iPad 3 will have a 2048×1536 “Retina” display.
After a display was acquired that was rumored to be made for the iPad 3, talk of a 048×1536 9.7 inch “Retina” display (the same display used in the iPhone 4) has been backed-up. MacRumors literally compared the supposed iPad 3 display to one from an iPad 2 under a microscope and found that the pixels on the iPad 3 display are one-quarter the size of those on the iPad 2.
More about this rumor:
http://aol.it/vZBxHY
http://bit.ly/xmmFEi
An image of the front glass of the iPad 3 reveals no significant changes (aside from a larger camera hole).
Chinese microblogging site Sina Weibo got its hands on what appears to be a glass screen manufactured for the iPad 3. The image shows that the front of the iPad 3 will be nearly identical to the front of the iPad 2, including the same round home button. The only differences in the display are a larger camera hole and an altered positioning of the inner ribbon cable.
More about this rumor:
http://bit.ly/yALxig
http://bit.ly/zdhvpc
Source suggests spring romance is budding between the iPad 3 and Ryan Gosling.
Ryan Gosling was evidently seen canoodling with the iPad 3 on the set of Only God Forgives this weekend. According to an eye-witness, Gosling was holding the iPad 3 in his hands and caressing it lovingly with his fingertips. Gosling was quoted as saying, “even though the iPad 3 doesn’t exist yet in the market, I can’t keep my hands off it. I find that I smile to myself throughout the day just thinking about my future with the iPad 3.”

Needless to say, we are on the edge of our seats for the official iPad 3 specs to be released so our team can get down to business designing an amazing case worthy of this fancy new tablet. Wah hoo!

Grove Leather Backs!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We are so excited to introduce the new Grove Leather Backs&nbsp;for the iPhone 4 and 4s!
Grove Leather Backs are genuine leather and hold fast to the iPhone with a special adhesive similar to double-sided tape. In typical Grove fashion, we use all-natural leather and craft the Backs entirely in our workshop in Portland, Oregon. Our 100% vegetable-tanned leather is sourced from Hermann Oak, one of the last tanneries still based in the United States.
We go out of our way to use vegetable-tanned leather because it’s all-natural, full of unique variations, and feels great in your hand. Real leather also ages gracefully, developing a beautiful patina with everyday use. &nbsp;We wax the edges by hand with natural&nbsp;beeswax!
Several of our team members have happily tested our Leather Backs on their iPhones during the past few weeks. The Leather Back is removable, and the adhesive leaves no residue or damage on the surface of the phone. You may be able to reapply your Leather Back effectively a few times, if necessary.
Available in London tan or black, the Leather Backs will be offered at a special introductory&nbsp;price of $19 for plain and $29 for the Artist Series. Be sure to place your order by March 31st,&nbsp;when the price will rise to $29 and $39, respectively.
We’re pumped about presenting our tightly curated Artist Series of world class illustrations in this medium. &nbsp;The Grove Leather Back is a classy and affordable way to set your iPhone apart while introducing a little art into your daily routine.
In the future, we’re planning to create a custom option for Leather Backs for the artists among you. &nbsp;The current lead-time on plain and Artist Series Leather Backs is two to four weeks.
Stay tuned for more info on new products from Grove right here and on Facebook.
Wrangle your iPhone and slap some leather on that lil’ doggie. Yeehaw!

MacWorld 2012
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Joe and I just got back from MacWorld 2012 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Neither of us had ever been and we were curious as to how the event was holding up since Apple pulled out a few years ago. Trade shows have been on the downturn in general and we've read that MacWorld has changed from a business-to-business model to a business-to-consumer model in an attempt to buck the trend. &nbsp;
&nbsp;
There were&nbsp;accessories&nbsp;for everything you could imagine! Lots were cheap, plastic, "Made-in-China" type goods. The most impressive products (coincidentally or not) were made in America and it was obvious that their employees were more knowledgeable and had greater pride in their offerings. Some things you just can't fake! Overall, there were many smaller vendors and fewer of the big boys such as Griffin and InCase. It seems like MacWorld is becoming a place for developing businesses to shoot for the big leagues rather than for established companies. &nbsp;
While we didn't have a booth this year, it was worth checking out just for fun. Maybe we will be back next year. So long MacWorld!&nbsp;

What says "Merry Christmas" better than helping in the fight to protect the world's sharks? Serious.
PangeaSeed is a grassroots organization based in Tokyo Japan dedicated to educating and raising international awareness on the plight of sharks and the destruction of their habitat. Through volunteer activism, research and the various mediums of art, music, film, and photography, PangeaSeed aims to create an open dialog with the global community to develop an understanding of the need to preserve and protect sharks and the oceans.
These guys are doing some great work for ocean conservation and have partnered with some amazing artists in the process, including Josh Keyes, Rhys Cooper, and the master behind our new case design, illustrator John Fellows.
We at Grove are very pleased to collaborate with&nbsp;PangeaSeed&nbsp;on our most recent iPhone 4/4S case release, and a portion of each case sold will go towards helping their cause. Additionally,&nbsp;please consider taking a look at PangeaSeed's website (which is a work of art in its own right) to learn more about their latest international events and what you can do to help. Be warned that some of the imagery may be graphic.

Grove at the Portland Bazaar
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We're stoked to be presenting at the Portland Bazaar this weekend at the Sandbox Studio building at 420 NE 9th Avenue, Portland. The Portland Bazaar is&nbsp;curated by Grace Bonney (Design*Sponge), Greg Hennes (Antler and Co.) and Matt Pierce (Wood &amp; Faulk). The fair is a celebration of some of the most talented makers in the Pacific North West and we're flattered to be chosen as a vendor. We'll be selling bamboo iphone 4 cases and bamboo art, and are excited to see what the other makers have to show off. If you happen to be in Portland this weekend, stop by to say hi!&nbsp;

Look at these beautiful Grove mustaches&nbsp;in training!&nbsp;
This month, the Grove Team has donated our upper lips to raise awareness for men’s health. Movember is a worldwide movement which helps raise funds and awareness to combat prostate cancer and other cancers that affect men. Grove will be matching the donations our team members receive. We’ll also be donating 100% of proceeds for the rest of November on the Mustache Bamboo Backs for MacBooks. Don't forget to visit the Grove Movember page http://mobro.co/grovemade to Donate!

Bamboo Bezel is Back!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
With the release of the iPhone 4S in white we have received an overwhelming number of requests to bring back the Bamboo Bezel. &nbsp;Its true, the bamboo bezel option looks much better than the black bezel on a white iPhone. &nbsp;We always try to listen to what our customers are saying and do our best to fulfill their wishes. &nbsp;
To commemorate the launch of the iPhone 4S we are bringing the bamboo bezel back at a special price starting at $69! &nbsp;I do really think it looks great on the white iPhone. &nbsp;I hope you do too!&nbsp;
