Living Consciously at the Grove Workshop
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We love Mother Earth-- who doesn’t? These days it’s easy and a bit cliche to state that you are environmentally aware, but together we Grovers are an eco-friendly bunch both at work and at home. This week we wanted to share a little of what we do to live conscientiously.
Living in the Pacific Northwest we are close to the natural environment. It’s a hop, skip, and a jump to the mountains, desert, coastal rain forest, the plains, and the Pacific Ocean. Grovers are an outdoor loving bunch and we want to do our small part to help to keep our environment clean and protected!
It’s hard to do everything yourself. So, here are some of our daily practices that collectively team Grove contributes to:
We recycle our trash and use our materials as efficiently as possible to reduce waste.
Many of us ride bikes every day!
We use metal water bottles and ceramic mugs for our piping hot green tea.
Some of us roll in hybrid cars. &nbsp;
We have a compost pile which makes happy healthy worms for Scott’s indoor aquaponic gardening project!
We cook at home and pack our lunches.
Sean’s got big plans for a small scale solar project at our new shop. (He’s also building a chicken coop at home!)
We support local organic farms and for those of us who buy meat and eggs we try to support free range farms whenever possible.
We try to reduce our plastic consumption by buying items in reusable glass containers.
In the summer months we garden and grow sprouts!
Grover Mike “Mac Daddy” Dowty has even sworn off showers to save Portland’s water supply. &nbsp;:)
How do you practice living conscientiously? We know that you can’t change everything, but every little bit counts. goGrove!

The Discovery of the Puppies and Kitties of Team Grove (As Narrated by David Attenborough)
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Every morning at the break of dawn all across our fair city of Portland, OR we Grovers are awoken by the triumphant calls of the wild beasts who live among us. They are the descendents of grey wolves and Middle Eastern wildcats. They are our pets. We feed them, walk them and love them. Here are some of the animals that we love!
Sylvia&rsquo;s cat got her name from the month of June when she was adopted. She&rsquo;s a 5 year old ragdoll mix who goes by many handles including Juniper and Junebug. &ldquo;We keep her because she's cute, and when she does show affection or allow us to cuddle her it's a golden moment.&rdquo; &nbsp;Haha. And the piglet? Well, that cute little guy lives on her friend's farm, and holds a special place in Sylvia's heart after looking after him for a few hours one summer afternoon.&nbsp;
San and his wife Junghwa recently found themselves a furry little angel with the heart of a lion and the temperament of a burning phoenix. Carmelo (aka lil&rsquo; Mello) is a 3 month old cockapoo puppy who just wants to play and wear his yellow rain slicker that his aunt Wendy got him. Also, he enjoys keeping his new mom and dad up at night with his whimpers. But oh my goodness is he cute... Good luck, San and Junghwa!
Laura and her fianc&eacute; Tobin rescued their dog from the Oregon Humane Society on Mothers day in 2011. He&rsquo;s a black lab mix who they named Ninkasi, after their favorite brewery. &nbsp;But mostly he goes by Kasi for short.A great companion, Kasi likes to be in the middle of everything-- especially hugs! He loves his hand knitted winter scarf his Gramma Peri made for him, and enjoys car rides, chasing shadows, nighttime laser runs (sometimes we think he identifies as a cat), and helping Laura and Tobin with their house construction.Laura said, &ldquo;His secret bad habit is putting both his paws into the water bowl when he's really thirsty. Even so, we still love him very much and our family wouldn't be complete without him.&rdquo;Awwww...
Mike Dowty aka Mac Daddy received his cat Leo under mysterious circumstances. No one knows who left a kitten in a basket on his doorstep on Christmas morning, but life wouldn&rsquo;t be the same without him. Leo aka Big Cat aka Daddy Cat Like is a Maine Coon with gorgeous cascading locks and an attitude that strikes fear in the hearts of small dogs.After moving into a new house Sean and Priscilla felt like something was missing. One fateful day they visited the Humane Society, where petless people go in and pet owners come out. &ldquo;We went just to look and came home with Oli.&rdquo; Oli is a pekingese papillon mix whose favorite things are taking Sean for a walk every morning and letting his mom Priscilla snuggle with him in his bed.
Ken&rsquo;s dog Roy is a rescue animal from the Humane Society who was named after the Blazers star Brandon Roy! He was such a skittish, shy dog that he remained un-rescued for over a year... :( &nbsp;However, the Humane Society did a promotion where they had the Blazers come in and name a dog for themselves. &nbsp;Hence, Brandon Roy! &nbsp;
The cat that I live among is known as Scratch (aka Annie Oakley). Currently, it is unclear who is the domestic pet and who are the people as she seems to run the house. Pictured above, she is relaxing on a ceramic tile (Is that comfortable, Scratch?) and also likes to sing the most beautiful and melodic songs for hours on end (also pictured).Written by Mike Schultz. He is an oil painter from Ithaca, New York. &nbsp;When he is not working for Grove, he&rsquo;s painting and drawing to his heart&rsquo;s content. &nbsp;You can see his work on his blog and his website.

A New Grove Notebook Design by Lotie Just in Time for Spring!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We&rsquo;re giddy over our new design Seasons for the leather Grove Notebook cover by our longtime contributing artist Lotie. &nbsp;Maybe it&rsquo;s because love is still in the air from Valentine&rsquo;s Day, or maybe Spring fever is kicking in a little early here in Portland. But, it&rsquo;s probably just that this notebook cover is so darn perty. We can&rsquo;t keep our eyeballs off of it!Check out our beautiful Wave bamboo iPhone 5 case by Lotie as well as her Nebula design on our iPad case! Lotie lives and works in Paris, creating dreamy illustrations with strong themes of nature and organic imagery. A truly unique signature style helped her work develop a strong following over time. Pencil, India ink, photography, and digital imagery come together to create her universes where the architectural and corporal meet.
Clip from Lotie&rsquo;s website Lotie.comA true Renaissance woman, before becoming a full time illustrator in 2003, Lotie received separate undergraduate degrees in history and art history as well as a Masters Degree in communications from the Sorbonne. She and her work have been featured in Form, Design Week, and Computer Arts, among other publications. See more about Lotie and her work, which has been exhibited in galleries in New York, Paris, Tokyo, and more, at Lotie.com.Don&rsquo;t forget to take a gander at the fresh Seasons Grove Notebook, starting at $69!

Grove loves Instagram! #Grovemade
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We
love using Instagram as a tool for sharing our culture, products, and
processes with our supporters. There is something special being able to
give a growing number of fellow Instagrammers a peek at what the Grove
world is like day-to-day. We encourage other Instagram users to tag
their Grove-related pictures with #Grovemade. Seeing Grove cases in
different environments is exciting for us! We’re always looking for rad
customer photos to add to our Grove Wall of Fame album on Facebook.&nbsp;
Apparently,
our love for Instagram is not unrequited. We were featured on their
suggested users list in September, which sparked a sharp increase in our
following. Instagram features suggested users that have beautiful
photographs and offer their own flavor of awesomeness to the Instagram
community. I’m sure most other users would agree, due largely to the
community it builds, this app is just so fun! And, with a new full-image feed for web browsers complete with liking functionality, Instagram is becoming more enjoyable and dynamic each day.&nbsp;
On August 31, 2012, Grovemade on Instagram had 901 followers; as of today, less than 6 months
later, we have 19,377. Thanks to our talented community manager Kim,
with her sunny outlook and eye for photography, that number is growing
everyday! A picture is worth a thousand words, but what about an
Instagram? We think it’s worth two thousand, at least. Share your Grove
inspiration with us on Instagram by tagging #Grovemade, and don’t forget
to follow us!

Meet the Head of Marketing and Social Media at Grove: Hi Kim!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Kim
is the glue that holds Grove together. One of Grove’s first employees,
she joined the crew in the summer of 2010, starting as a production
assistant, and then developed our customer service department from the
ground up. She now manages all of our social media on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and handles all of Grove’s press releases to get us sweet mentions on sites like Uncrate and Design Milk!
This
lady wears several hats - on top of all of that, Kim also coordinates
Grove’s internal social events like quarterly outings, birthday
celebrations, and makes sure we all get fed at company lunches. We’re a
hungry bunch, so you’ve got to be prepared if you have that job! We like
to think of her as Momma Kim - the Momma bear of Grove.
Kim
grew up in Canby, Oregon and attended the University of Oregon,
graduating in 2009 with a degree in Art with a focus in drawing and
painting.
Football
is in her blood! Her dad took her to her first football game when she
was just one week old. She grew up going to football games and looking
up to her older brother, who taught her how to throw her wicked spiral
pass. Needless to say, she is a dedicated Oregon Ducks Season ticket holder who sports green and yellow every chance she gets - especially on game day.
Outside
of work, Kim loves spending time with her family and finding new
adventures with friends. She has four nieces and one nephew who keep her
pretty busy (they call her Auntie Kim - cute!).
Kim’s
a walker, a hiker , and a professional Portland neighborhood explorer,
who enjoys discovering pretty nooks, gardens, and awesome architecture.
She loves photography and recently got out her old 35 mm camera to begin
taking film photographs again.
Other
hobbies include running half marathons - three in the past two years -
and expanding her music collection. Blues, soul, and motown are her
jams. Recent favorites are Allen Stone and Maverick Sabre. We’re so lucky to have a person like Kim on our team!

MacTrast Features our Wool Felt Sleeve for iPad!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We’re so pleased and flattered that MacTrast featured
our Wool Felt Sleeve for iPad! Writer Chris Rauschnaut gave our sleeve
an in-depth review after an extended testing period. If you want to know
how a Grove Wool Felt Sleeve can change your life, check out Rauschnaut’s write-up.
He says, “The new iPads are premium products and the accessories chosen
to cover them should be made with similar workmanship.”
We
can’t help but agree that there’s nothing better to slip your iPad into
at the end - or beginning - of a long workday. We sew each sleeve in
our Portland, Oregon studio with care. Slide your ‘pad into premium wool
and all-natural bamboo, snap shut the magnetic closure, and keep your
sleek tablet covered while you’re out and about.
“Grove
certainly changed my idea of what quality, made in the USA accessories
for the iPad, should be made like,” writes Rauschnaut. “Stepping up to a
premium and fashionable case for the latest iPad, while simultaneously
knowing the tablet is secure, is easily accomplished with the Bamboo
&amp; Wool sleeve made by Grove.”
Read the whole review on MacTrast, and don’t forget to check out our Wool Felt Sleeves for iPad, priced at $79.

Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Grove Moleskine Notebooks
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
In
a time ruled by touchscreens, there is still something sacred about
putting pen to paper. This is why we love our notebooks, and why we
chose to design a reusable product that protects them in style. Our Grove Notebook leather covers are carefully hand sewn here in our Portland, Oregon workshop, and they can be engraved with one of our beautiful artist series designs or your own custom image.
Choosing the leather...
We
work with one of the largest tanneries in the USA to source the
highest-quality vegetable-tanned leather for our products - always
tanned right here in the States using bark tannins. Our natural,
vegetable-tanned leather is free of harmful chromium and ages
gracefully, developing character over time.&nbsp;
What is vegetable-tanned leather...
The
natural leather we use contains no harmful chromium. Most leathers are
chrome-tanned, or tanned using chromium sulfate and other salts of
chromium. Vegetable-tanned leather is tanned using ingredients found in
vegetable matter and tannin, such as tree bark. This is the only
acceptable leather for engraving, because it does not release harmful
fumes when heat is applied.
Why Moleskine notebooks are the best choice to fill your Grove leather cover...
Grove chooses Moleskine
because they stand behind their philosophy of timeless excellence in
notebook making. Moleskines are modeled after the trusty notebooks used
by artists and thinkers of the past, such as Vincent van Gogh, Pablo
Picasso, and Bruce Chatwin. As the company’s philosophy states, Moleskines are “A
simple black rectangle with rounded corners [...] a nameless object
with a spare perfection all its own [...] invaluable sketches, notes,
stories, and ideas that would one day become famous paintings or the
pages of beloved books.”
Do you have some ideas worth protecting? Check out our Grove Notebook leather covers for Moleskine, starting at $39 for plain/pocket-sized. Happy imagining!

Grove Production Manager: Sean Kelly!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
The
truth is that the woodshop where we make our cases would literally
grind to a halt if it wasn’t for our production manager, Sean Michael
Kelly. To sum up what he does is a difficult task because he wears so
many hats -- and even Sean says he doesn’t really know what he does here
at Grove. But here’s a try: Sean does his best to make Grove a fun and
upbeat environment to work in. He guides everyday production, works in
line, continually develops production processes, and does specialty
design work with both products and packaging. He’s also one of Grove’s
original members who started as an intern two and half years ago! Sean
likes to think that he has literally touched every single case that has
been made at Grove.
Sean
grew up in the Southwest Hills of Portland with his parents and two
younger siblings. &nbsp;He attended the University of Oregon and graduated in
2010 with a BFA in Product Design. &nbsp;
During
his time at Grove Sean got married to the love of his life Priscilla,
bought a house, and they now live just outside of Portland with their
beastly man-dog Oli who is believed to be a reincarnation of a Civil War
era soldier name Oliver.
Sean
breathes and thinks design. More than anything else, he’s interested in
how we interact with each other and the world around us. He’s made
beautiful streamlined furniture, an interactive communication device
using light, and is currently working on an engaging teaching tool for
children with Autism. He grew up with a carpenter father and an
architect grandfather who both influenced and inspired him to do this
type of work from a young age. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To see some of Sean’s work you can visit his website here.
Sean is the one who found the coveted shop wheelchair in which each and
every one of us eats our lunch together. Thank you, Sean!

Grove is Thankful for...
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
On
the eve of Thanksgiving, Grove has a lot to be thankful for! One of the
most important things we’re thankful for are the amazing customers that
make our company possible. The patience and support of our fans is
literally what keeps us going. Additionally, the whole team is thankful
for each other, and for the support we can offer to one another
throughout this busy case production season. As with many of you, we’re
also thankful for the friends, family, health, and this beautiful city we’re
lucky enough to enjoy. Here’s a little rundown of what some of us are
thankful for:
Mary is thankful for friends’ helping hands.
Ken is thankful for the best food carts in Portland and all the delicious lunches they provide.
Joe is thankful for Battlestar Galactica.
Max is thankful to work with a bunch of bright eyed kids with awesome senses of humor, and for Adventure Time, and also for heat and showers.
Cindy is thankful for our bi-weekly full-team work lunches :)
Laura is thankful for the health of her family and friends, and her sweet doggie.
Galen is thankful for steady employment in a time when many go without.
Kim is thankful to live in Portland and work in a place where she’s able to learn and grow and can also gut-laugh on a daily basis.
Ellie is thankful to get to experience the upcoming Civil War game between the Ducks and Beavers.
Mike D. is thankful to never actually have to decide which to fight, one horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses.
Barrett is thankful for apple pie.
Wendy is thankful for hot Sriracha and warm scarves.
Lydia is thankful for bananas and their dwindling population.
San is thankful for all the foods.
Mike S. is thankful for art and the internet.
Sylvia is thankful for second chances.
Sean is thankful for friendship, love, and his beautiful wife, Priscilla.
Tommy is thankful to have friends he considers family and family he considers friends.
We’re
a pretty thankful, loving, and food-crazed bunch, I’d say. It’s amazing
to get to share time with each other at work each day, and we’re
grateful to those that support Grove and help us to keep bringing our
little pieces of functional art into the world.
Grove wishes you a cozy Thanksgiving with your family and friends! (What are you thankful for?)

iPad vs. the iPad Mini: Which is Better?
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Does
size really matter? With the recent release of the iPad 4th generation
and iPad Mini, we’re about to find out! Bloggers are already coming head
to head on the issue, and there’s praise on both sides of the fence. Business Insider
outlined five key issues that should sway your vote: portability,
affordability, signal strength, speed and strength, and retina display.
With
its 7.9 inch screen, portability is the iPad Mini’s main event. The
iPad 4 beat weighs more than twice the Mini. Starting at $329,
affordability is the other draw of the little guy. However, if you want
to run demanding apps, the iPad 4th gen. is your tablet. Its new A6X
processor is twice as fast as the 3rd gen. iPad, while the iPad Mini has
the same processor as the iPad 2. Both tablets have 4G LTE cellular
service plans. Here’s the kicker - the iPad Mini does not have the famed
Retina Display of the new iPhone 5 and the iPad 4th gen, and for good reason. This is the dealbreaker for many folks with discerning eyes, but it’s not the end-all-be-all to some.
Nick Bilton of the New York Times’ Bits blog quotes John Gruber of Daring Fireball:
John
Gruber, the author of the Apple blog Daring Fireball, unsurprisingly
loves his iPad Mini more than chocolate cupcakes with sprinkles on top.
“I
completely stand behind mine, and still have barely even used the iPad 4
I have on loan from Apple,” Mr. Gruber wrote. “In the meantime, we have
to choose: big iPad with sharp retina display, or small iPad with a
fuzzy one. I’ve gone small and fuzzy.”
Even
the Grove team is on the fence; co-owner Ken uses the Mini in the shop
and loves its lightweight feel, but he sure does miss that sweet retina
display. We agree on one point, unless you’re fundamentally against
small things, the better ‘pad depends entirely on your needs.
Unquestionably, though, you do need a Grove Wool &amp; Bamboo Sleeve to snuggle your prefered iPad in this winter.&nbsp;
Which iPad would you buy? The iPad 4 or the iPad Mini?

</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Here at Grove, we believe that one of the best canvases for engraving is our new iPhone 5 case. &nbsp;We’ve introduced a new collection of eye-catching patterns for our case with clever inspirations to strike your fancy. Twin Peaks fan? Check out our “Black Lodge” iPhone 5 case! Getting back into The Great Gatsby just in time for the anticipated blockbuster this holiday season? Take a gander at our “Gatsby” iPhone 5 case!&nbsp;
Our patterns were designed by our creative team here as well as our friends and neighbors at PEETKEGLER,
who specialize in art direction and graphic design for brands such as
Burton and Nike. Grove co-owner Joe has been obsessed with patterns his
whole life, sees them almost everywhere he looks. “Norwegian Wood” was inspired by his girlfriend’s mittens from Norway. &nbsp;“Golden” is the Fibonacci
sequence seen in the center of sunflowers. Joe has been known to
embarrass his friends by stopping people on the street to admire their
lovely patterns.
With
the launch of our new case, we’ve also made available a new
monogramming option that let’s you add a quick personalized touch to
your case for a $14.99 fee. Monogramming is available on the the bottom,
top, or side of the plain case, as well as on the side of any pattern
or artist series case. Just check the box for monogramming before you
add a case to your cart.
As
always, our artist series remains a solid offering for our iPhone 5
case, and will continue to grow with new illustrators from around the
world. New patterns may be added as well, if Joe gets his way. Check out
our pattern and artist series cases here, at just $99!

Grove Gives an Update on our iPhone 5 Production Process
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
If you've ordered our iPhone 5 case and checked out the shipment date estimates, you'll know the lead time on the product takes a lot of patience. We're working around the clock to get each case finished and out the door, and we so appreciate our amazing customers that understand why we do what we do.&nbsp;
In our co-owner Ken&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;The heart of our business is that we make our own stuff. We design and build our own products.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve been working hard at designing and implementing our new production process for the iPhone 5 case. It&rsquo;s always challenging to see a product through from design to use, and a main challenge this time around is that we&rsquo;re combining two different materials into one product. Luckily we have the machinery and talent to pull it off! &ldquo;It all starts with the team,&rdquo; says our production manager and designer Sean, &ldquo;all of us who make the cases. Figuring out how to use the team to create the best product we can.&rdquo;
If you&rsquo;re designing and crafting products on a fast timeline like in the mobile phone industry, you&rsquo;ve got to be up for a challenge. Our general manager, Galen, secretly relishes the little &ldquo;headaches&rdquo; that go along with production process design. &ldquo;Even though it may seem simple,&rdquo; he says that there&rsquo;s a whole lot of research and development that goes on behind the scenes. Especially when working with a new material. He stands behind our commitment to &ldquo;maintaining an attitude and drive of constant improvement.&rdquo; Our production team knows first hand it takes teamwork and patience to figure out every detail - Sean says, &ldquo;We need to fail a lot before we can succeed.&rdquo; It takes mental and physical strength for this type of hands-on production, and our entire team is willing to go the extra mile and work overtime hours to reach our goals.
Innovation is a big part of our everyday process. Ken explains, &ldquo;The fact is that we can make changes and improvements rapidly - because we do it ourselves!&rdquo; Most production facilities will outsource a lot of work, but we do it all here in our little shop. From website photography, copy and programming, to filing all the holes in your iPhone Case, to sewing each stitch on your Felt Sleeve, we do it all. Challenge-wise, the new materials certainly make for increased complexity in production, according to everyone on production. Galen clarifies that &ldquo;Ultimately, the goal is to create the best iPhone case we can for our customers, and with the new design, we think we've done that.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s where the challenges pay off.
Ken states, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s really important is to have an open mind and constantly make our production and processes better.&rdquo; Sean has other reasons for our hands-on methods though: &ldquo;Our hands touch every case everyday, so when you use your phone it is like we are touching your face tenderly. If I stand still and quiet I can almost feel your voices in my hands...&rdquo;
We appreciate our customers more than anything, and we couldn't exist without your patience and support! Thank you for enabling our vision. Weekly-updated shipment dates for the iPhone 5 are posted here.

Wendy, Oh My!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Wendy Oh is the custom arts specialist for our iPhone cases.
When you want a custom design on your Grove case and you send in an
image- it’s Wendy who adjusts your picture to make sure that it is
beautiful and ready to be engraved! &nbsp;
She
grew up in southeast Portland, OR near Reed college with her mom, dad,
and younger brother. One of her favorite places in Portland is still the
extraordinary Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden near her childhood home.
Wendy
graduated in 2011 with a Bachelors of Architecture and a minor in Art,
with an emphasis in ceramics from the University of Oregon. While she is
technically a U of O “duck”, she says she does not quite “fit the bill”. (We have a lot Ducks in our midst here at Grove.)
While
in school she found that art and ceramics helped to balance out the
heavy workload of the architecture program. Infamously, she applied for
her position at Grove three days before her thesis presentation for her
Architecture final!
While
not at work what Wendy really loves to do is to eat great food. She
recently stated, “I am the Hulk when it comes to desserts.” Macaroons
and ice cream are in the house!
Besides eating amazing food, Wendy likes to keep herself active with yoga,
kickboxing, bootcamp, and running. She also loves hip hop, jazz,
watching basketball, and reading books. Currently she is enjoying The Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut as well as What the Dog Saw by Malcolm Gladwell.
Famously, Wendy’s met Trey Songz in a line at Burger King at the San Francisco airport while she claims she was looking disheveled, but probably not this disheveled.

The Grove iPhone 5 Case is Ready to Order!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Break. out. the. bubbly. It&rsquo;s official - our iPhone 5 Case is ready to order! More durable than our last case and still made with all-natural bamboo, this case is something to be proud of, and we&rsquo;re thrilled to release it for sale. If you haven&rsquo;t heard about it yet, our new Bamboo iPhone 5 Case is made from a close-grained bamboo exterior and a solid surface material interior.
Choose your iPhone 5 case in plain, Artist Series engraved, pattern engraved, or engraved with your own custom image. With a&nbsp;core and bezel in either black or white, your case will go perfectly with either iPhone 5 color. The inner core is tough and smooth, and the bamboo exterior shows off the natural grain of our signature bamboo.&nbsp;
As always, each case is hand-finished and carefully treated with a natural citrus oil and wax blend. We craft all our cases right here in our workshop in Portland, Oregon.
The Grove Bamboo iPhone 5 Case is available now starting at $79 for plain, $99 for engraved, and $129 for custom. (If you previously purchased a pre-order code, don&rsquo;t forget to enter it under &ldquo;discounts&rdquo; at checkout!)

The Best of Summertime - Work Hard, Play Hard!

</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Summertime!
After working hard through Portland’s gray winter and enduring months
of rain and cold we Grovers need to replenish our vital life energy with
fun, food, and sunshine! &nbsp;
A brief poll around the shop led to this summary of favorite summer adventures and getaways taken by us lucky Grovers.
First, one of us got hitched! Wahoo!
Highlights
include: An excursion to wine country in California for a wedding, a
trip to Alcatraz, drinking hot cups of joe in beat poet cafes in San
Francisco, ziplining through the forest like maniacs, enjoying a demolition derby northern Washington, camping, hiking, and sasquatch spotting on the Oregon coast, padding the pavement in New York City and Brooklyn, museums, art, amazing food and friends, and lot and lots of summer heat and sunshine!
Apart from our big trips, there have been other good doses of summer in our everyday activities like bike rides up to Mt. Tabor and Laurelhurst Park, picking berries on Sauvie Island,
running in Forest Park, and enjoying walks Portland’s Rose Garden.
&nbsp;There have also been picnics, barbeques, birthdays, and excursions to Ken’s secret swimming hole. &nbsp;
Last but not least every day on misty Oregon mornings Ollie the dog is taken for his walk!

Grove&#39;s Everyday-Carry: The Daily Essentials of Our Lead Graphic Designer
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
&nbsp;
We’re excited about this everyday carry edition - who wouldn’t want to take a peek into the world of our lead graphic designer, Max Brown? Check out his daily essentials below, and maybe catch a bit of insight into why he’s such a neat-o dude!
1. Insize Digital Calipers
Although I'm not involved in much physical design at Grove, I'm constantly surprised by how often I use these. Discovering the ability to measure something down to the 4th decimal place and then enter that data right into Adobe Illustrator completely changed my perspective on translating the physical world into digital.
2. Coffee
Two cups, black.
3. Wacom Intuos 4 Drawing Tablet
For drawing or just everyday web surfing, once you go Wacom, there's no going back to a mouse. When I was 20 years old I spent my life savings of $300 on a Wacom Intuos 3 tablet. That was nine years ago, and I still use it every single day at home. I can safely say it was the best $300 I've ever spent.
4. iPhone 4 with the Grove Bamboo Case
I'm currently sporting the new prototype made in preparation for the updated iPhone 5 case, and it feels solid. I don't use bold lightly.
5. Copic Multiliner SP ( 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.7 mm)
I used to love the more common Pigma Micron markers (the ones with the tan, plastic body) but they have the bad habit of drying up almost instantly. These markers from Copic seem to last three to four times longer and the metal body feels a lot better in your hand. They're a bit more expensive ($12),but they're also very easy to refill.
6. Mechanical Pencil
My lucky pencil given to me by a friend about seven years ago. I'm desperate to find out the brand name of it because I've done roughly 95% of my life's work with it, and I'm starting to get concerned that the magic is in the pencil. I should keep it in a safe.
7. Staedtler Mars Plastic White Eraser
I picked one of these up on the first day of art school and now it seems like I have one on my desk, in my pocket, in my glovebox, under my pillow, etc. Undo! Undo!
8. USB Thumb Drives
I always have at least one thumb drive in my pocket, and yes, this one is made out of bamboo.
9. Captain Ron (1992) on DVD
When illustrating from home, I always have something playing in the background to break the silence. Most of the time that something is 1992's Captain Ron starring Kurt Russell and Martin Short. It's like being on a tropical vacation, but the movie really isn't very good so it never distracts me from what I'm doing. Other background favorites are Roxanne (1987), Weekend At Bernie's (1989), and Summer School (1987).
10. Moleskine Sketchbook with the Grove Leather Notebook Cover in “Snakes” by Dan Funderburgh
Moleskines are great, but it took me a long time to realize that I could just use the sketchbook paper option for more than just drawing. It's my top choice for everything from finished drawings to short story writing.
Thanks for peekin’ and learning just a little bit about one of our amazing team members!

Introducing Our Newest iPad Case Design from Kozyndan
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We’re happy to introduce The Stormy Sea, a brand new iPad case artist series design from Kozyndan! The husband and wife team of Kozue and Dan Kitchens have a prolific work history in illustration and fine art, and we’re so excited to work with them! We definitely recommend exploring the mysterious Kozyndan world on their website.
The pair’s solo shows include Their Bones Are Coral Made at Bold Hype Gallery in New York City, Washed Away at Outré Gallery in Melbourne, Sydney, and Perth, And Then There Were None at Nelly Duff Gallery in London, and The Unknown Portraits at Narwhal Art Projects in Toronto, among others. The two-artist team has also participated in several group shows. Their illustrations and designs have been widely used for clothing (a Spring 2009 Puma line), album art (The Postal Service, Daedalus, Weezer), ad and editorial work, jewelry and posters, and other fascinations.
According to their website, Kozyndan “are obsessed with the ocean and being underwater and hope to someday come to rest at the bottom of the sea and slowly be devoured by deep creatures over many years.” In the same nautical spirit, pick up your “The Stormy Sea” iPad case today - it’s $20 off through this week!
