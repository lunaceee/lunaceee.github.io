<a href="#iphone-case-drop-proof">
Are Grovemade cases drop proof?
</a>
</h4>
<div class="answer" id="iphone-case-drop-proof">
No, Grovemade cases are not 100% drop proof. Being made of natural materials, your case may not survive an impact. This is true of any case made of bamboo or wood. Your Grovemade case will protect your iPhone and iPad from normal wear and tear, but it is not guaranteed against drops of any kind. For cases that break from being dropped, we offer our <a href="http://grovemade.com/support/warranty-form/">Case Replacement Program</a>.
Because natural material varies greatly, sometimes the case survives really harsh drops onto concrete, other times they break from the slightest drop onto carpet. This depends on the unpredictable chance of where it hits and the variation in the material. This is why we say our cases won't survive drops, even though they often do. If you are prone to dropping your phone, we suggest cases made of silicone or rubber, such as Otterbox.
Although we cannot guarantee it, there have been numerous incidents where iPhones and iPads have been saved by our case. Like a motorcycle helmet, it might break in a crash, but it will save your iPhone or iPad's life.

<h4 class="question">
<a href="#how-will-my-case-wear-over-time">
How will my case wear over time?
</a>
</h4>
<div class="answer" id="how-will-my-case-wear-over-time">
The case will wear gracefully like fine, hand-oiled furniture. The oils from your hand polish the case, as a result of the natural oil and wax finish used on the wood or bamboo.
If you want your wood or bamboo to be completely sealed, we recommend purchasing from manufacturers who clearcoat their products with a layer of plastic.

<a href="#can-i-use-3rd-party-headphonesdocks-your-case">
Can I use 3rd party headphones/docks with your case?
</a>
</h4>
<div class="answer" id="can-i-use-3rd-party-headphonesdocks-your-case">
In general, probably not. Our headphone hole diameter is approximately .3 inches, and it will easily fit the Apple headphones but not headphones with a much larger jack.
If you would like to use larger headphones, you can use an adapter, which can be readily found for under $10. We recommend searching "iPhone Headphone Adapter" on Amazon.com.
We have a <a href="http://grovemade.com/collections/dock">Grovemade Dock for iPhone</a> that works with our cases. We haven’t tested other docks with our case. A lot of docks will not work with most hard cases, including Grovemade's. If you are having trouble with using your Grovemade case on a third party dock, you can look into adapters called "dock extenders".

<a href="#what-finish-you-use-cases">
What is the finish you use on the cases?
</a>
</h4>
<div class="answer" id="what-finish-you-use-cases">
We hand rub our cases with a natural oil and wax blend. This brings out the luster of the grain and enables you to feel the natural material for what it is.
The finish on our bamboo and wood products has a VOC content of <270g/liter. The finish on our cases is fully cured before they leave our shop.

												We use 100% solid Moso bamboo. We work with bamboo, because it's highly sustainable. Moso bamboo grows very fast, and is therefore highly renewable -- more so than other trees. This is not the bamboo that pandas eat.

											</h4>
											<div class="answer" id="there-flash-distortion">
												iPhone 5s
Using flash photography with the iPhone 5S Case in the dark, at distances further than a few feet away, can cause a whitening of the images. If you must take a far away photo in the dark with your iPhone 5S, we recommend removing the top half of the case before doing so. Below is an example of a photo taken in the dark at more than 10 ft away with an iPhone 5S:

(For iPhone 5 flash test results, see "Other Products")

Other Products
Unlike with the 5S, our tests using the flash with the Grovemade Bamboo Case for iPhone 4/4S and 5, Grovemade SkateCase, and Grovemade SkateBacks only showed a very slight whitening of the image. In most circumstances, images didn't differ perceptibly, and results varied depending on distance and ambient light

											The outer hand represents the hour and the shorter hand represents minutes.  The timepiece moves just like a traditional analog watch, the difference being you glance at the positioning of the circular hands through the windows and infer the approximate time.  It takes about a day to get used to it and then you can tell the time to about 2 or 3 minutes precision.  You can see the animation on our landing page to see how it works.

												Please be aware that UPS will request payment of customs, duties, and other applicable charges at the time of delivery. Many Customs Offices require recipients to pay applicable duties and taxes on each shipment entering into that country. These charges may include PST, GST, HST, duties, and other taxes of goods (e.g. excise tax). 

Canadian Recipients
Your order will be shipped under UPS’s e-Tailer Brokerage Program (eBP), in which eligible UPS Standard shipments imported into Canada for non-commercial purposes and valued under CAD $200 are subject to a reduced brokerage fee of CAD $10, plus any applicable duties and taxes. (Orders over CAD $200 may incur additional charges.)

To pay these charges ahead of time and eliminate the need for payment on delivery, please call UPS (1-800-742-5877).

For States That Do Have Sales Tax

The current default rule throughout the United States is that you must collect sales tax on Internet sales to customers in those states where your business has a “physical presence”—assuming, of course, that the state involved has a sales tax. The physical-presence rule is based on a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-0194.ZO.html">1992 United States Supreme Court decision</a>, Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, that addressed the obligations of mail-order businesses to collect sales tax on out-of-state sales; the decision has been extended to include online retailers. Generally speaking, a physical presence means such things as:
having a warehouse in the state
having a store in the state
having an office in the state, or
having a sales representative in the state.

If you do not have a physical presence in the state, you generally are not required to collect sales tax for an Internet-based sale to someone in that state.

												How durable is the case? Will it survive a drop?
											</a>
										</h4>
										<div class="answer" id="new-case-stronger-will-it-survive-drop">
											All wood cases, ours included, may not be the best choice for people prone to dropping their phones. Grovemade cases are not 100% drop proof. The case may not survive an impact. This is typical of many cases made from natural materials or hard plastics. If you are worried about dropping your phone, we suggest cases made of silicone or rubber, such as Otterbox.
   
That being said, we’ve engineered our cases to be as durable as possible. Although, we can’t guarantee the case against drops, it is possible for it to survive many standard drops, along with some gentle wear-and-tear. 

In the event that your case breaks from a drop, we offer a <a href="http://grovemade.com/support/warranty-form/">case replacement program</a>. For any manufacturing defects, your new case is covered under our standard <a href="http://grovemade.com/support/policies/">warranty</a> from the date that the case is shipped.

										<div class="answer" id="will-screen-protectors-work-iphone-5-case">
											Yes. Any type of front screen protector, covering only the screen of the phone, will not interfere with the case. However, due to the tight fit of our case, any screen protectors which wrap around the sides or back of the phone are not compatible.

										<div class="answer" id="how-can-i-clean-case-and-maintain-it">
											Use a damp rag to rub the case clean, then dab it dry with a clean cloth.  If needed, use a diluted solution of water and mild dish soap on a rag and wipe dry. This is not a necessary step, but if you would like to re-oil the case, you can use boiled linseed oil.

											No. There are two different Lightning to 30-pin adapters offered by Apple. Neither of these adapters will work with the bottom of your Grovemade case on. They are both larger than the regular Apple Lightning charger.

We are not yet aware of other third-party adapters that will work with the bottom of the case on. However, if the Lightning head of the adapter is the same size or smaller than the regular Apple iPhone 5 charging cable, the adapter should work without removing the bottom of the case.

											</h4>
											<div class="answer" id="can-i-use-3rd-party-chargers-or-dock">
												The Grovemade case supports the charging cable that is supplied by Apple for your iPhone model only. The bottom hole for the charger is as large as possible without compromising the structural integrity of the case. We are not able to verify all third party connectors. If they are significantly larger than the original charger that came with your phone, they may not fit.

The <a href="http://grovemade.com/collections/dock">Grovemade Dock</a> will work with our cases. We have not tested other docks, so we cannot guarantee they will work with our case. Many docks will not fit the case. You may have to remove the bottom half of the case to use a dock. You can purchase dock or charger extenders and adapters at third-party retailers, which may help you use your accessories with your case on your phone.

Warning: Forcing a charger that is too large into the case will break it. Please be careful. Many chargers look nearly identical. Older iPhone/iPad chargers may look the same but be too large for the case.

											<a href="#will-dock-work-my-case">
												Will the Dock work with my case?
											</a>
										</h4>
										<div class="answer" id="will-dock-work-my-case">
											The Dock is designed to work with or without a case, but we cannot test every single case out there. It is guaranteed to work with a Grovemade case, which tends to be on the thicker side. This means most cases will work. 

Measure your case to see if it will fit within the Dock’s opening size of 2.66" x .64". See <a href="http://grovemade.com/product/walnut-iphone-dock/?initial=34"> here</a> for the complete Dock dimensions.

												How does the Dock affect the phone&#39;s sound?
											</a>
										</h4>
										<div class="answer" id="how-does-dock-affect-phones-sound">
											The Dock is designed to amplify the sound coming out of the iPhone's speakers. A hidden channel directs ringtones and other audio freely through the front of the dock. You will actually hear an increase in volume with your phone docked.

										</h4>
										<div class="answer" id="which-iphones-are-compatible-dock">
											No.The dock works with iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5S, and 5C. Unfortunately, our Dock is designed specifically for those iPhone models and will not work with other. The iPhone 6 dock will have different dimensions.

											<a href="#does-dock-charge-your-phone">
												Does the Dock charge your phone?
											</a>
										</h4>
										<div class="answer" id="does-dock-charge-your-phone">
											Yes, the Dock charges your phone using your own Apple 1M cable, which feeds through the bottom.

Please note that our Dock does not come with a charging cable, and only the standard Apple cable that comes with the iPhone will work with the dock.

										<div class="answer" id="which-charger-cables-will-work-dock">
											Only the original charger, provided with the iPhone, is compatible with our iPhone Dock. Any chargers/cables (including other Apple cables) could break the key component of the Dock station. 

*Please be aware Apple does sell charger cables slightly larger than the standard Apple cable. These cables WILL break the key insert to the Grovemade Dock.
