Bumper for iPhone is One of Our Most Earth Friendly Products Yet
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We’re very excited about our Bumper for iPhone. We were happy to launch it, because we love the look, affordability, and functionality of the product. However, in addition to that, it’s arguably our most sustainable product when it comes to manufacturing waste. Green manufacturing and reducing waste in manufacturing have always been goals here at the workshop.
Similar to proper cookie cutting technique, when the Bumper is milled from maple or walnut wood, we are able to use nearly all of the material that we procure. In other words, a very high number of Bumpers for customers’ iPhones can be made from an impressively small amount of material.
Co-owner Joe Mansfield explains why this is one of his favorite products to-date:
“It’s designed to utilize the strength of the material but none of the weaknesses. The bumper is perfect for the minimalist. Our revolutionary production process allows us to utilize nearly 95% of the material. Very little waste is created. I’m really proud of how little waste material is left over.”
 
 
Reducing material waste not only gives our company more resource efficiency and helps us keep doing what we do, it also reduces pollution and is friendlier on the planet. It’s a win-win-win situation for us, the consumers, and our environment. We strive to make as little material waste as possible with all our accessories, and the Bumper is certainly a victory in that regard. We are proud to contribute to the earth friendly products out there for consumers.
We’re hoping our customers continue to enjoy the feel of the product, as much as we enjoy the production of it. Co-owner Ken Tomita comments, “The engineering behind this product is amazing; we’ve been able to make something so thin and small out of wood that’s so strong, we’re pushing the limits.”

Meet the Brass Dock for iPhone and Walnut Back for iPad + MacBook
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We thought, “how can we make our iPhone Dock exceed its current level of badassery?” The answer was to machine it out of radiant solid brass. As with our solid steel model, it’s manufactured right here in Oregon and includes a new and improved iPhone 4, 4S, iPhone 5, 5S, + iPhone 5C cord adapter.
A limited edition of 175 individually serialized pieces, the Brass and Walnut Dock is the culmination of our efforts to create a luxurious place for your Apple iPhone with even more distinction than steel. Crafted from solid brass with an Oregon black walnut cap, it’s heavier than our 3 lbs solid steel Dock. Procuring and milling solid brass was a challenge, but the juice was worth the squeeze.
High-end furniture inspired us for this special edition Dock for iPhone (all editions). This piece won’t budge; it’s even heavier than our solid steel dock. Plug and unplug your phone one-handed and keep your charger cable in its place.
Along with the new Limited Edition wood iPhone Dock in Brass and Walnut, we also launched a walnut version of our Bamboo Back. Now you can also spruce up your Macbook and iPad with gorgeous, locally sourced Oregon black walnut. Like our Bamboo Backs, each one is made in the Grovemade workshop and hand sanded and oiled for a smooth feel.
The Walnut Back adheres with a 3M adhesive that does not leave a permanent residue and is compatible with Macbook Air and Pro 13”, Macbook Pro 15”,  iPad Air, iPad Mini, and iPad Mini with Retina Display.
Get 20% off the Walnut Back today only (April 15, 2014) using the code: WalnutBack20.

Grovemade.com Praised for Great Web Design
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Design has always been central to what we are about, and that extends from our products all the way to good website design. And, great websites are a valuable thing. This winter, we worked hard on a complete rebrand and redesign with some very talented friends and contributors in order to bring the new Grovemade.com to life. We are very happy with our new site in terms of visual appeal, user experience, and how it tells our story. Luckily, we’re not alone; there’s been public praise on blogs that feature the best website designs, and customers have been telling us good things.
“When the collaboration is humming along well, you can get to a magical place no one can get to alone. The best creatives can listen to our feedback and work together with us to help us fulfill our vision. This experience has truly been a victory of team over individual.”  - Co-founder Ken Tomita
 
 
We were lucky enough to be able to assemble a team with designer and art director Peter Baston, photographer Chris Mueller, our in-house designer and photographer Max Brown, our in-house writer Mary Yajko, copywriting consultant Thomas McCracken, and our developer extraordinaire Yuji Tomita. Peter’s eye for style and his design guidelines are invaluable to us. Chris’s stunning photography helps us keep a gorgeous record of our workshop culture and our team. Max’s clean product photography and content design is the sustenance of our rebrand. Keen web copy does our story justice. And, Yuji makes it all possible with his custom backend web programming that keeps Grovemade.com not only handsome but also hard working.
 
 
Here are some links to website design blogs that have mentioned our site as an example of great website design:

Introducing the Bumper for iPhone 5/5S/5C
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Compatible with iPhone 5, 5S, and 5C, the clean design of the Bumper compliments the look and feel of the naked iPhone and is a perfect solution for the minimalist seeking style and protection. This unique all-wood bumper is handcrafted in our workshop in Portland from local black Walnut or domestically sourced Eastern Hardrock Maple.
 
The Bumper’s one-piece design utilizes the strong direction of the wood grain and Grovemade’s signature joint design for sturdy corners. The lustrous black, silver, or gold metal of the iPhone 5/5S and the vibrant color of the 5C are in full view with this accessory. Wooden actuated buttons provide a satisfying user experience, and the edge of the frame keeps the phone safely raised up from flat surfaces.
 
The Bumper is sustainably crafted in the Grovemade workshop in Portland, creating almost no material waste. This product is compatible with the Dock for iPhone and all front and back screen protectors. Enjoy hand-sanded, hand-oiled wood for the introductory price of $39 on Grovemade.com.

Creative Uses for our Packaging
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We put thought into developing the perfect packaging for our products, packaging that serves its purpose well without being wasteful. We truly enjoy our packaging for our iPhone cases, and we’ve found it can be super fun and useful even after you take your case out and get it onto your phone. Here are some ways we use the cardboard frame:
 
Dock and Stand: Slip the case onto your phone and pop the whole thing back into the cardboard frame for a versatile and stripped down version of a dock. Stick a pencil or stick in it and stand it up however you’d like!
 
Video Game Controller: Pull out the pencil and you’ve got an easy way to get a good grip on your phone while you play your favorite racing game. Vrooooom, vroooom, errrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeesch, vroooooom!
 
Picture Frame: Are you a repeat customer? White wash a bunch of frames or just leave ‘em bare, and you’ve got a whole crop of easy-to-hang picture frames. The pencil or stick as a stand trick works here too -- or just push it onto a small nail to hang.
 
Horseshoe Game: Maybe our favorite way to use old frames here at the workshop is to toss them like a frisbee at various targets. A peg makes this an indoor, (relatively) safe-for-work version of horseshoes!
Forget having a great iPhone case; heck, we think the cardboard frame is motivation enough to place an order. Good thing we’re rich in cardboard here at the workshop! (Evil laughter).

We&#39;re Lucky Because...
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
It’s St. Paddy’s Day, and at the Grovemade workshop, a lot of us are wearing green and feeling lucky. For us, it’s important to “live green” everyday -- biking, recycling, composting, being careful about waste. But today, “green living” means feeling lucky, enjoying each others’ creative spirits, pulling up our lime colored socks, counting our “Irish Blessings,” and yes, maybe enjoying a pint or two of a fine brew.
Here are some reasons we’re lucky:
 
Sylvia: I'm lucky because I can sleep anytime and anywhere!
Joe: I'm lucky to call this beautiful city home; there's no shortage of good people, microbrews, bespoke goods, affordable food, and adventures.
Danielle: I'm lucky because I get to ride by the Belmont Goats when I bike to work.
Barrett: I'm lucky because I get to work with all my friends!
Ken: I’m lucky because I have someone who will scratch my back.
Teryn: I'm lucky because I am surrounded by the best friends, family and dog anyone could ever ask for!
Scott: I'm lucky that i love to eat but i also love to run.
Yuji: I'm lucky because there's always a tape ball, water balloon or nerf bullet flying through the air.
Galen: I’m lucky because ramyun is cheap and delicious.
 
Whether or not you’ll be celebrating St. Patrick’s Day, we hope you enjoy your week and stay safe! It’s time for the team to go rehearse our choreographed Irish jig.

Limited Edition Case in Collaboration with YACHT
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
A limited edition of only 100 pieces, each case comes with a cassette single of "Plastic Soul", including a free digital download.
  
A collaboration with Los Angeles based music group YACHT, this case for iPhone 5/5S features the playful work of illustrator Tim Lahan. Created for the band’s new single, Plastic Soul, the design is direct printed onto hand-finished, domestic Eastern Hardrock Maple.
 
YACHT is a conceptual pop group based in Los Angeles, California. The core duo is Jona Bechtolt and Claire L. Evans, whose wide-ranging interests cause YACHT to frequently metamorphose: from band to belief system, from disco infiltrators to punk rockers, from performance artists to graphic designers, publishers, sculptors, or philosophers. YACHT has released five full-length records and has toured with LCD Soundsystem, Vampire Weekend, and the Postal Service. 
 
The Plastic Soul design featured on the case was created by Tim Lahan: artist, illustrator, and friend of YACHT, living and working in New York City. See more of his work on TimLahan.com or trademark-trademark.com. Lahan divides his time between The New York Times, Jack Spade, Nike, and McSweeney’s and draws a semi-weekly comic called Today or Tomorrow.

Digital Trends’ Write-up and Video Profile of Grovemade
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
“These guys can’t sit still,” writes Digital Trends about our team here at Grovemade.  Earlier this winter, the popular technology news site wrote a profile on our company highlighting our spontaneity and innovation in product design. Watch the wonderful video they made to accompany the article, below:
 
 
The article focuses on our development of the Wood Smart Case for iPad Air and iPad Mini in one week, around the time of the iPad Mini 2 launch. We’re very grateful to have been featured on Digital Trends in an article that acknowledges the passion behind our crafting.
 
Digital trends writes, “Part of that seat-of-the-pants building process plays to their personalities. ‘Both me and Joe are more like spontaneous guys,’ Tomita says. ‘We’re good at just being thrown in there and just doing things on the fly. I’m used to doing project work for festivals and stuff. You only have like a week, you just have to make stuff up and go with it.’”
 
Descriptions of our workspace show off our penchant for hands-on development: “The detritus from this unconstrained creative process litters Grove’s office: whimsical laser cuttings of bears and gears, pennant lamps made from bamboo, a tiny ball-in-maze game made from laminated plywood.”
 
 
“Ultimately, the challenge suits them. ‘If we were just making belts or something, we would just design it once and it would be around for decades,’ Mansfield explains. ‘We have this opportunity – we’re forced to constantly innovate. It puts a lot of pressure on us, but I think in the end it’s a good pressure. It’s a good stress.’”

Meet Grove’s One and Only Brodie!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
 
 
Brodie is an Oregon native who grew up in Forest Grove.
 
At work he lasers things with his eyes. Brodie is the laser master. He lasers and prints products and oversees the shipping of orders. He’s the one that makes sure all products get made to order as customers’ place orders online.
 
 
Outside work he is hiking and discovering new hiking adventures and ideal camping spots. Brodie also might be working on his car, if it has broken down recently. And, he tries to find new places to eat in Portland that are interesting and outside the radar.
 
Brodie’s good at multitasking and being appropriately OCD about lean manufacturing, making sure everything gets done efficiently -- both at work and at home.
 
 
He enjoys traveling and experiencing different people’s beliefs and perspectives on life. Of the 12 countries he’s been to, two of his favorite places are Ethiopia and Palau. Brodie also enjoys spending time with friends and family and having bouts of ridiculous laughter.
He's had a lot of experience teaching, but he doesn’t have a teaching degree. He’s taught English and been a substitute teacher from nursery school to grade 12, and he’s taught kids with special needs in both middle and high school.
 
You might not guess that Brodie was a child model for Nike, Adidas, and Columbia sportswear. He used to have pictures in the Oregonian that his classmates would cut out and tease him with at school.

Solid Chocolate Case for iPhone 5/5S: Melts in your hand, and on your phone.
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
For your sweetie with a sweet tooth, we’ve crafted a functional Grovemade iPhone case made from solid dark chocolate. It’s completely edible! With the mission to make the best chocolate case, we teamed up with local chocolate maker Charley Wheelock of Woodblock Chocolate.
Woodblock Chocolate is a family run, bean to bar chocolate manufactory here in Portland -- the result of years of hard work from wife and husband team Jessica and Charley Wheelock. They start from scratch with the cacao bean and are proud to be part of the American craft chocolate revolution.
Check out the special features of the Chocolate Case:
Delicious, thin, and sleek
Made from premium single origin, bean-to-bar chocolate optimized for CNC milling
Special collaboration with our friends at Woodblock Chocolate
No emulsifiers, like soy lecithin, means more concentrated flavors and a higher melting temp
Made entirely in the Grovemade workshop in Portland
Ergonomic button openings with full access to all ports
Precision-milled from a solid block of deliciousness
Hand finished to be velvety smooth to the touch
Alright, so THESE ARE NOT ACTUALLY FOR SALE. We can’t keep making them without gunking up our machines with that sweet stuff. They are pretty fun to play with though!

The Top 5 Grove Stories from 2013
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We’ve had quite a year at Grove; so much has happened. We can’t believe the year has come to an end, and we wanted to reminisce on some of our favorite things that happened this year. From 10-foot-tall Christmas trees to tubing on the river, from re-designing products in one week to some of the most exciting announcements, 2013 was one remarkable year.
 
Moving Our Entire Workshop
This year, we moved our entire workshop from two floors of the Town Storage Building, which we shared with several other small Portland businesses and creatives, to a new location in Southeast Portland all our own. It was great to move from having our operation shared between two floors to having everyone on the same level. It’s also pretty sweet having our own building. We’ve had a good time slowly renovating and redecorating: we’ve even got an indoor mural by Japanese artist Mhak and an outdoor mural by Brazilian artist Marcelo Macedo!
Summer River picnic and Waterfall Hike
This summer was full of sunshine and good times. We made it a point to do some summer group activities. Our waterfall hike at Oneonta Gorge was a real adventure; the hike involved scaling a giant pileup of logs and wading in freezing cold water up to our chins! We also had an amazing cookout at the Sandy River. We set up a little food tent and made ourselves at home all afternoon. Highlights included intense games of frisbee, naps in hammocks, and tying all our inner tubes together to try to float on the river in tandem.
 
iPad Cases Re-Designed
We decided to bring back the Grove iPad case this year with the new Wood Smart Case for iPad Air and iPad Mini. The development process was fast-paced and exciting. Read about that here! The case features a new construction method and three versatile standing positions. Eastern Hardrock Maple creates a sturdy frame and a flexible bamboo cover gives you standing options, while strong rare-earth magnets hold the tablet in place. This is one of our most unique cases yet.
 
The Giant Christmas Tree
Joe surprised us this Christmas season when he showed up at the workshop with a huge Christmas tree that was at least 12 feet tall. We were all giddy like little children when the behemoth first graced us with its presence. The best part was that when Joe and his girlfriend Rachel picked up the tree, it was too big for the machine that compresses and ties up the tree, so they tied it to the roof of their little Subaru with its massive width almost enveloping the entire car and turning heads all the way down the highway.
What to Expect When Grove’s Expecting
For the first time in Grove history, we’ve got little baby team members on the way! This year, two team members are each expecting their first new additions to their families. Can you guess who the two parents-to-be are?
 
There you have it. What could 2014 have in store that could top this? I guess we’ll find out!

Grovemade&#39;s New Year&#39;s Resolutions of 2014
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
A couple of us have some important New Year’s resolutions for 2014. We wanted to share them to hold ourselves accountable and also to give you some ideas if you haven’t come up with a resolution yet. We’re planning on having a wonderful year here at the Grovemade workshop!
Max: “Draw even more. (Draw more was last year's resolution).”
Jim: “More yoga time!”
Ken: “Get my back healthy again so I can play basketball.”
Danielle: “I want to web publish a comic I've been working on writing the past few years. It's scary, but I'm gonna take the jump.”
Sylvia: “To be more prompt and not procrastinate (as much).”
Dashia: “Be more compromising.”
Teryn: “Stop drinking so much Coca-Cola (or at least cut back to one/day :-)”
We hope that inspired you with your own resolution. Happy New Year from Team Grove!

From Start to Finish: The Grove Dock
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
The Grove Dock is one of our favorite products here. We just love plugging and unplugging our phones with one hand, and our desks look so sharp. The Dock is also one of our most interesting products to manufacture, because we are using a steel component for the first time ever. Here’s how we make them:
1) The heavy steel bases are milled out of a solid block of steel for us by a partner company close by in McMinnville, Oregon. Our machines can handle machining metal but we have them setup for wood, so our friends about an hour southwest of Portland mill this component of the Dock.
2) The steel bases are then sent to two other partner companies nearby Portland -- one company adds nickel plating to the silver Dock base and the other company adds a black coating to the black Dock base (the same black coating used on black knives and guns!).
3) We receive the steel bases here at our Grovemade workshop, and inspect each one very closely for any scratches or imperfections.
4) Meanwhile! In our workshop, we’ve been working hard to mill the bamboo Dock caps out of solid blocks of bamboo, like our Bamboo Cases for iPhone. We hand sand and apply a natural citrus oil and wax blend to each cap. Finally, we laser engrave our logo into the bamboo.
5) We also laser cut the various insert keys out of black acrylic, which are used to pinch the charging cable inside the dock so it can be adjusted to be used with or without a case. We make one key for the 30-pin adapter and one for the lightning adapter.
6) We laser cut the black cardboard sleeve which we specially designed for the packaging of the dock. Our logo is featured in cutout form on the sleeve, along with the satisfying perforated strip you can peel back when you first open your Dock!
7) Finally, we pack up each Grove Dock for iPhone kit ourselves and ship them from our workshop to you!
Remember -- this thing is wonderfully heavy! We’ve said it before, but please, please, PLEASE don’t drop this Dock on your toes!

Give the Gift of Grove
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Why does Grove make the perfect Christmas gift, you ask? Why, take a seat here by the virtual blazing fireplace, and let us pour you a proverbial cup of hot cocoa and explain. The first thing to understand is that there’s something on Grovemade.com for everyone on your holiday gift list. I’m SERIOUS, guuuuys. Here look:
 
For the traditional buddy with a heart of gold
You know what phone they have, because you’ve seen them slyly glancing at it during boring hangouts. Get that steadfast buddy the classic, beloved Bamboo Case for iPhone 4/4S and 5/5S. Where could you go wrong with lovely hand-sanded and oiled bamboo. Go for plain or one of the more simple engravings or challenge your buddy to think outside the box with a trippy artist series design.
For the night-owl techie with their head always in an e-book:
Let me guess, they’re up on all the latest and greatest tablets like a bear on honey. They need dem cozy pants and warm slippers, a warm drink, and their iPad Air or iPad mini flipped open to their fave game, blog, or e-book. Knock their slippers off with a darn beautifully crafted Wood Smart Case, and take their iPad browsing to the next level. [Please note, this gift also works for the small biz entrepreneur that never has time to hang out.]
For the stylish significant other that you need to impress:
So maybe you already got them the predictable gift that they already sort of know about. We recommend also getting a surprise gift, and what better to surprise them with than a completely one-of-a-kind customized WoodPrint Case for iPhone 5/5S? This sexy case is made from smooth maple, and you can upload any image you’d like to customize it, such as your lover’s artsy instagram of last night’s sunset. Bonus points: customize it with a picture of the cat you two co-parent. D’aww.
For the person who is the coolest and deserves the best gift:
This person is probably your super cool mom or dad or someone that you have a really big crush on or someone that you have children with. If they like color and are still young at heart, they get the SkateCase for iPhone 5/5S. Recycled skateboard material makes this case as cool as this person. If they are more serious (read: too cool for school), then congrats to them; they get the Grove Dock for iPhone. This is a useful iPhone accessory as well as a well designed accent for the home or workspace.
For the person you don’t want to spend that much on
The Bamboo Back for MacBook or iPad is slick looking and also affordable at just $29. It’s kind of like buying them a new MacBook or iPad. They will basically freak out. Or, you could get them a leather notebook cover starting at $69 for an artist series design including pocket-sized Moleskine notebook. Look at this beautiful cover design by French artist Lotie.
Do you see? Grove really does make the best gift! Happy holiday hunting to all!

Team Grove&#39;s Holiday Wish List
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
The holiday season is upon us! Can you even believe it? This season is all about wishing and hoping, staying cozy, and being thankful. Team Grove has some wishes and hopes for Christmas. If you’re out doing holiday shopping and wondering what to get for your favorite company, here’s our official wish list:
Snow
Ginger and Sean are both wishing for snow. It doesn’t snow much in Portland. Most of our snow comes in liquid form, if you catch my drift. (See what I did there?) Nevertheless, we still pine longingly to wake up to the white sparkly wonderland of a snowy Christmas morning. Just sayin’.
Pendant Light from Schoolhouse Electric
Mike Dowty is wishing for this lovely Harding 6” Pendant Light from Schoolhouse Electric. This Portland company is of the highest quality, and their product description says it all: “Our exclusive parts are made of heavy gauge, solid American brass and hand-finished in our state-of-the-art patina shop[...]our craftspeople in Portland, Oregon, build each fixture to your specifications.”
California King Bed
Dashia is wishing to sleep like a queen on an iComfort mattress from Serta. What better way to drift off?  If she could choose any size, she thinks California king is the way to go. Until then, let us all appreciate Rihanna’s ode to large beds.
A Papaya Tree
Scott wants a papaya tree. Just call him PawPaw Snair.
A Horizontal Milling Machine
Ken wants the DMC 125 H duoBLOCK horizontal milling machine. If you’re a milling dork like Ken, you would enjoy this machine’s large traverse paths of 49.2 x 39.4 x 41.3 inches and high pallet load up to 4,409.2 lbs. It’s ideal for large-parts machining. Not to mention its smaller footprint for more efficient production. Yeah, it’s like the machining version of asking Santa for a BMW, but one can hope, right?
The Newest iPhone
Like some of us here at Grove, Teryn hasn’t yet gotten her hands on the newest version of Apple’s iPhone, the 5S. The newest iPhone is definitely a hot commodity, especially if you are eager to use one of our newest cases. And, we’ve said it before, the iPhone 5S is sleek, sexy, and full of advanced features and functionality.
Time With Friends and Family
Galen is wishing that everyone on Team Grove gets some quality time with their friends and family during the holidays. Grove will be closed for the Christmas week and New Years to ensure we all get some warm-fuzzy time.
Finding the perfect gift is important, but we all hope everyone is more concerned with finding the perfect recipe, perfect hot cocoa to marshmallow ratio, and perfect spot on the couch for prime fireplace or Christmas tree viewing. Happy Holidays from us here at Grove.

Our Schultzy is Doing a Kickstarter!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Our very own Mike Schultz is doing a Kickstarter called Thailand Burma Flora Fauna: A Handmade Print Series. We’re all supporting him because we love him, but we’re also doing it because we love beautiful handmade artwork. Mike wants to create a new series of linocut prints of the flora and fauna of Thailand and Burma, designed as part of a workshop with an arts and crafts studio on the Thai-Burma border.
Checkout his project page and the video that a couple of us helped put together with Mike!
   
Buying handmade prints is special on its own; however, when you buy them through this Kickstarter, you’re not only supporting the creation of an entire series, but you’re also supporting valuable workshops for apprentices at the Puzzlebox Art Studio. This keeps the studio running, providing invaluable community benefits for the apprentices that depend on the studio for daily support, training, and language skills.
Mike spent 15 months on the Thai-Burma border in 2010 and 2011, where he helped establish the Puzzlebox Art Studio. He’ll be returning there at the end of this month to work with the studio staff on this new series of designs. The Puzzlebox provides a safe space for Burmese migrant youth to work as artist apprentices learning useful skills that they would otherwise not have access to. After five months, he will be returning to Portland to create the print series.
 
Please help make this wonderful artwork possible by purchasing some through the Kickstarter! Thank you so much for reading.

10 Things We Love About PDX
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Hey, we love this town. Here are 10 reasons why Portland should be your favorite city too:
1) The City - The city of Portland is darn lovable. It rocks fall foliage all the way through November, and it even wears clouds well. We love the overcast skies of autumn and winter, because they keep out the wimps. You like tall buildings? We got “Big Pink” poking the sky right there. You like nature? Gaze just beyond the buildings and you’ll see giant evergreens peeking over from the hillsides.
2) Art - Portland is a great place for art lovers. We’ve got the Portland Art Museum and countless smaller galleries and cafes that show art. Many artists call PDX home,  including Jon MacNair, Amy Ruppel, and illustrators Josh Kenyon and Colby Nichols, AKA Jolby. Here’s a photo from a Jolby show this past year at Albina Press.
3) Friends - How could we not love Portland? It’s home to so many of our friends and loved ones. PDX is infamous for fun loving antics as well. We know how to have a good time here, day or night. Here’s a classic shot of Team Grove outside the Portland Art Museum.
4) The Wilderness - Portland is surrounded by beautiful scenery, which makes sense in Oregon, a state boasting a treasure trove of gorgeous landscapes. The towering evergreens lend a magical quality to Portland’s surrounding forested areas. Walk straight from Portland’s dense Northwest neighborhood into Forest Park for miles of serene hiking. Bursting with moss, ferns, and douglas firs, the Pacific temperate rainforest is green year-round!
 
5) Donuts - Need we say more? Yes, we know everyone is aware of the awesome offerings at VooDoo Doughnut, but our personal favorite is Delicious Donuts. Better get there early before they sell out, though!
6) Coffee - Portland is the land of coffee aficionados, yes, but us normal folk also benefit from the plethora of local coffee shops and roasteries around every corner. We’ve got Stumptown, we’ve got Ristretto Roasters, we’ve got Water Avenue, and we’ve got a personal favorite, Get About Coffee, which had its badass beginning at local Roller Derby bouts!
7) Music - Portland’s got a wonderful local music scene, and is always bringing in great acts from out of town as well. One of our favorite things to do here is check out a show at a local venue. This past year, Astoria, Oregon’s Blind Pilot played with the Oregon Symphony at the ritzy Arlene Schnitzer concert hall downtown.
8) Food Carts - It’s simple really - we’ve got a whole population of food-loving, tough-skinned, hard workers in this city. We needed to figure out how to fit the most convenient, unique, locally made, yummy foods as we could into our available space; the answer was food carts. Around every corner, there’s a little pod of food carts popping up and staying open late.
9) Business - We’ve got a wonderful local business community in our corner of Oregon, including countless smaller operations like us (Grove!), Bridge &amp; Burn, and MapleXO, medium-sized ones like Leatherman and Pendleton Woolen Mills, and giants like Nike and Adidas. Check out the above picture of Team Grove on a field trip to Leatherman last winter.
10) Bridges - There are eight, soon to be nine, bridges just in the downtown area of Portland alone. We don’t call it Bridgetown for nothing! This city knows how to get from point A to point B in style. Bridges here connect one neighborhood to another, one side of the river to the other, and yes, they look good too.
See, it’s your favorite city now, isn’t it?

Grove&#39;s Favorite [Silly] iPhone Accessories!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We like to keep ourselves in the know about what’s what in the world of iPhone 5 accessories. The quirkier the better -- which isn’t to say these strange and amusing accessories aren’t also super useful! Check out some of our favorite unique iPhone accoutrements:
 
The Crankerator
If you’re stuck out in nature with no outlets and your phone is dying, have no fear. Charge it with your elbow grease. “It's a tiny brick of extra energy for your phone or tablet. Charge it by plugging into a wall, or just crank that (Soulja Boy) handle.”
 
The iPhone SLR Mount
“This case-adapter combo lets you mount your Canon EOS or Nikon SLR lenses to your iPhone 4/4s/5/5s giving your phone powerful depth of field and manual focus.” In other words, it’s a tool to let you easily achieve master status on Instagram.
 
 
ARKHIPPO Case
This hefty rubber chunky case flies in the face of iPhone accessories that tout their “sleek and thin” feel. The ARKHIPPO gives your phone weight, toughness, size, and the ability to stand in a bunch of different positions.
 
BREFFO Spiderpodium
“[The] 'take it everywhere, use it anywhere' Spiderpodium portable dock &amp; podium is a universal, multi-purpose, gadget grip, holster, dock and display podium[...]” We love our Spiderpodium, and had a great time using it as the Green Thing in our #FridayCatTraps!
 
The Natural Acoustics iPhone Amplifier
This super fancy passive iPhone amplifier acts as a stylish unplugged speaker for your phone. “Designed in Milan, it is handcrafted entirely of slip-cast ceramic fired in Vincenza, renowned since the 18th century for its traditional ceramics that have been compared to the finest Chinese porcelain.”
 
The Original Patented Knucklecase for iPhone
Here’s the case for you if you want to keep a guarded grip on your phone at all times! “Each Knucklecase is painstakingly machined from a solid block of aluminum. We only work with the finest machinists in the United States.”
There you have it - some accessories we think stand out among the same ‘ole, same ‘ole.

Meet Dashia, Grove Production Assistant!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Dashia has been with Grove since the end of summer, but we’re pumped to finally introduce her here on the blog. We’ve been so happy to have her as a member of team Grove! She’s such a sweet and positive presence here at the studio.
Her role at Grove is production assistant. Dashia works with her hands to finish and perfect each case in the woodshop. An iPad Mini fanatic, she’s stoked to be working on the new iPad cases. As you can see, Dashia also put her all into dressing up for Halloween this year, when she channelled a butterfly to match her rad tattoos.
 
Outside of work, Dashia is a loving mother of two, a runner and basketball fan, and a talented crocheter of scarves. She also loves to build just about anything from bookshelves to skyscrapers. Her life revolves around her mini-me’s, son Taishawn, 15 years old, and little daughter Camellia, 16 months old. Camellia never leaves Mom’s side around the house, and, at barely 1 1/2 years old, can already say just about anything Dashia can say. She loves to talk and even has her favorite books memorized to read aloud!
Dashia is the ultimate team mom for teenage Taishawn. She NEVER misses a basketball game and always excitedly gathers up gear in the team colors for her and Camellia to wear when they cheer in the stands. Taishawn may be a little embarrassed to have the loudest cheer section, but his cheerleaders shout it out anyway!
When she’s not on duty as team mom, Dashia is looking forward to going to the movies (at least once every other weekend for sure) or going for runs with her fiance Demetric. She’s a previous half-marathon runner that loves to keep up with her swift sweetheart. And, during downtime at home, it’s all about working on the hats and scarves she’s passionate about crocheting.
The most important things to Dashia are all the little moments in each day where you learn something new - that and family. Family is always first for her, and we’re so happy to have her in our Grove family!
Yay for Dashia!
