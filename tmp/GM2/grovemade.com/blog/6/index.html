The iPhone 5 is Officially Announced by Apple! Grove Reacts.
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
The
iPhone 5 was announced by Apple at their 2012 iPhone 5 keynote today!
Everyone here at Grove was anxiously awaiting the specifications of the
phone, and a chorus of high-fives sounded throughout our workspace as
the details came to light. We took a risk this year and decided to
design our new case
and make it available for pre-order before the specs of the phone were
officially announced. Lucky for us, the rumor mill was on target
(Although Ken thinks it's less exciting this way)!
Thrill
over our case design is one thing, but I think everyone’s got a bit of a
crush on the iPhone 5 itself. I’m pretty sure most hearts in Grove are
lusting after the new iPhone - yes, partially because it means we get to
use our iPhone 5 case.
Here’s a rundown of some initial reactions from the Grove team:
Sean (Designer and Production Manager):
“I love the mix of materials and how elegantly they use them. I love the back. The sexy back.
My favorite part of the presentation was when the iPhone rose from the
stage. It reminded me of the golden statue in Indiana Jones.”
Max (Lead Graphic Designer):
“I can’t believe I’m getting my fourth iPhone. Things have come a long way since 320x480!”
Ken (Co-owner):
“It wasn’t exciting this time because there were so many leaks!”
Joe (Co-owner):
“I guess I’m just blown away with the meticulous attention to detail as always...and the manufacturing methods employed.”
The specs of the iPhone 5 courtesy of CultofMac:
Same width, but slightly taller
New 4-inch, 326 ppi Retina display with 1136×640 resolution and 16:9 aspect ratio
A6 CPU is 2x faster than the iPhone 4S’s A5 CPU
New 8-pin Lightning sync-cable replaces old 30-pin connector
LTE, HSPA+, and DC-HSDPA cellular data and 802.11 a/b/g/n Wifi
Battery life improved to 8 hours of 3G/LTE talk time
Camera upgraded to 8-megapixel sensor with hybrid IR filter, five element lens, and f/2.4 aperture
Panorama feature can create 28-megapixel photos
Screen has 44% more color saturation and improved integrated touch sensors
Three new microphones and Enhanced Audio
7.6mm thin, which is 18% thinner than the iPhone 4S
112 grams, which is 20% lighter than iPhone 4S
Comes in black and white at 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB
Priced at $199, $299, and $399 with a two year contract
Pre-orders start September 14th and ship on September 21st
Read more about the new iPhone 5 at TUAW and CultofMac! And don’t forget to pre-order your iPhone 5 case from us before September 31st to reserve your place in line and get an extra $20 off!

Bon voyage, Arty! We’ll miss you!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Let’s set the record straight-- Arthur “Arty” Johnstone’s mom makes all of his clothing, and he looks great! &nbsp;He
is like a handsome sasquatch, tall like a brontosaurus, and he loves
bad movies like The Norseman (1978). He is also a painter who loves Die Antwoord-- check out his website here!
Arthur is a light hearted sanding machine who keeps everybody happy while we work. He is known in the woodshop as The Beard of Zeus-- one who has perfected the art of sanding and shaping iPhone cases, skatebacks, and iPad cases. He excels at chamfer and backsanding!
A few months ago, we wrote a post about Arty and his woodshop series of prisma color drawings
that he made here in Grove’s shop! He keeps a painting studio in a
space at the Recess Gallery, and has recently been working on a large
volume of collaborative work, including a time lapse video of painting of a Portland’s Willamette River.
Sadly, like a meandering and lonesome cowboy on the prairie, he is now leaving Grove to move on to greener pastures. He
will first embark on a pilgrimage to the major art hubs of the United
States. You may catch a glimpse of him on the Amtrack train or Greyhound
bus trolling through your town. He’s destined for Seattle, San
Francisco, LA, Chicago, Boston, and New York City. &nbsp;He wants to see how
independent artists make a living outside of the corporate structure.
Arty says more than anything he will miss working with this collection of well dressed people. &nbsp;While drawing his coworkers on our breaks he says he imagines us wild stallions...
Bon voyage, Arty! &nbsp;We’ll miss you!

is not working for Grove, he’s painting and drawing to his heart’s
content. &nbsp;You can see his work on his blog and his website.

Grove iPhone 5 Case is Available for Pre-order Now!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
The Grove team is delighted to announce that our new&nbsp;iPhone 5 case is available now for pre-order! We re-designed our case to be thinner, sleeker, more durable, and still made with all-natural bamboo. Give your new phone a case that&rsquo;s modern, gorgeous, eco-friendly, and practical! Equal parts sustainability and eye-catching form, our smartest design yet involves combining two materials - a renewable bamboo exterior and a strong, solid surface material core. In signature Grove style, we design and make the case entirely here at our Portland workshop. Up until September 30th, you have the chance to&nbsp;pre-order the case for a special discounted price ($20 off) AND a secure place in line before those who don&rsquo;t pre-order. Pre-order prices for the case start at just&nbsp;$59*. (For more information on the pre-order, please visit our iPhone 5 case&nbsp;FAQ).
We don&rsquo;t get any special insider information on the new iPhone, so we&rsquo;ll be watching patiently when the new iPhone is released on September 12th - just like you! Once we have the new iPhone in our hands, we&rsquo;ll finalize the case so it fits like a glove. Thank you for reading and don&rsquo;t forget to reserve your iPhone 5 case!
*Discounted pre-order prices : Plain Case ($59), Engraved Case ($79), Custom Case ($109)

Ups(tairs) and Downs(tairs): A Grove Process Interview
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We
wanted to share a little about how Grove operates day to day in our
work space. Because we share a building with several other creative
businesses and individuals, our workshop is divided between two
different floors. In this charming, brick, industrial building, our
woodshop is on the very bottom level, and our laser studio is located on
the very top floor. That’s five flights between the upstairs and
downstairs teams. We only use the industrial lift when we have something
heavy to carry, so we all have super strong legs. “Legs like trees,” we
like to say!
I
asked our general manager Galen and our woodshop production manager
Sean to add some insight into how they keep everything together, without
being two places at once:
How do you manage two production areas?
Galen - “It used to be a challenge but like many of the hurdles we’ve faced over the life of Grove, we’ve adapted and we’re working as hard as we can to unify our production team.”
Sean - “You have to constantly remind yourself to get in contact...we meet every morning...we levitate to each other out the windows too. And use cans with string. I use smoke signals as well...carrier pigeons. You know.”
The
downstairs woodshop, or “the shop” as we call it, is where we bring in
our raw bamboo or skateboard material, mill it with our machinery, and
sand and finish each case by hand. That’s also where we have our
barbeques, manage our compost pile, and grow our fledgling patch of
bamboo!
Upstairs,
or “laserland”, is where we have our lasers, sewing machines, and
quality control areas, as well as our shipping, design, and customer
service pods. Laserland also has arguably one of the best views of the
Willamette River, downtown Portland, and all its bridges!
Before
our current building, the lasershop and woodshop used to be in two
different locations entirely. Even though we’ve got Grove down to one
building, we’re still moving toward eventually having one large workshop
and more streamlined and unified processes. The production teams have
been spending time lately cross-training in various tasks.
Before our current location, Grove used to be in two different buildings. How has being in one building affected the company?
Galen
- “Going into one building - super game changer - now everyone knows
each other. Now we have to run up five flights of stairs instead of
running for 2 ½ miles.”
Sean
- “When I worked in the old wood shop we didn’t really see the laser
shop people very often, so it’s been really great merging the two
shops...Plus we’re not sharing a space with other woodworkers that have
their own projects going on.”
You’ve started cross-training the production team so everyone learns every task. What are the benefits of that?
Galen - “It gives us ultimate flexibility if people are out on vacation or sick. We can shift them and still get production done.”
Sean
- “It makes our relationships with each other stronger, and it makes us
understand how our actions can affect each other. You see the big
picture, where before it was compartmentalized. I mean, we’re all BFFs,
but now we’re even closer BFFs.”
What’s the ideal Grove space?
Galen - “The ideal would be one ginormous production space so that we can all be happy together forever.” [the end].
Sean - “Maybe we should get an elevator...to space. Or an underground mountain lair. In a volcano.”
Grove
probably won’t be moving into a ginormous underground volcano lair
anytime soon, but we’re always working toward being the most unified and
productive team we can be!

The City of Green Roses
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
This
week we wanted to share a little more about the city where Grove is
based-- Portland, OR. We are fortunate to have a proactive and forward
thinking community that is investing in a better future for our city and
its residents. Grove fits into this community by making our cases using bamboo- a renewable resource.
Here is an informative video on Portland’s sustainability initiatives that was made by artist Andrew Dickson for the Portland Office of Sustainability. &nbsp;
Below
is a small selection of the green initiatives that Portland is
investing in. (Besides what Portland is known for- like an amazing
network of bike lanes.)
1. Bioswales
What’s
a bioswale? Bioswales are elements designed into the landscape that
help to reduce pollution in our waterways by removing silt and filtering
out toxins from surface runoff water. &nbsp;This helps to keep our rivers
clean and make our city more beautiful by adding more greenery to boot.
2. Green Eco Roofs
Green
roofs are beneficial in many ways. &nbsp;They help reduce carbon dioxide
levels, reduce rainwater runoff, provide habitats for urban wildlife,
filter the air and reduce air pollution, and significantly lower the
overall temperature of a city.
Check out the downtown Portland library’s eco roof! &nbsp;
3. Solar Energy
Portland
is a leader in installing and maintaining solar panels. Solar is the
most reliable and renewable of all of our energy resources. By
transitioning to solar energy we can reduce our dependence on costly and
polluting fossil fuels. To learn more, here is a link to Solar Oregon.
We love this town.
Go Portland!

Dano the Machinist!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
To the laypeople of the world, Dano is a machinist. &nbsp;But the real deal is that Dano (aka Jeano) helps in the design, prototyping, and manufacturing of the production of our products. This winter he was instrumental in redesigning the iPad case. More recently he’s been&nbsp; focusing on developing the&nbsp;skateback, the major innovation of this product being the design and construction of a vacuum table that allows for speed of manufacture while simultaneously minimizing waste.
Dano
hails from Salem, Massachusetts, the Halloween capital of the universe!
He graduated from Reed college in 2009 with a BA in Psychology. In
school he was most interested in the neuroscience side of psychology and
currently splits his time between Grove and a research lab at OHSU
where he uses a gigantic MRI machine.
Right now, he has a project with two other friends called The Humble Velocipede
on Kickstarter. This project owes a lot of its success to Grove, as
Dano used his design and machining experience from his work here and
applied it to the Velocipede.
When he’s not as Grove you can find him enjoying bike rides, kittens, hot coffee and listening to Mariah Carey. Songs like Fantasy and Emotions really power him through the day!

"Depths Below" original by Tasha Chapman
“The
diving whale invites you to follow him into his serene world below the

water flows slower, and chaos dissolves into liquid.” &nbsp;- Tasha Chapman on “Depths Below”
Tasha, a.k.a. Jewelwing,
is a full-time artist and a lover of the ocean and its inhabitants.
When she’s not in the water, she’s channeling her fascination with
nature into beautiful illustrations. Tasha’s designs are now in a
permanent collection on T-shirts.com and have also been sold at Urban Outfitters, Threadless, shirt.woot, Society6, and Goodjoe, among others. The Atlantic Ocean is Tasha’s Etsy store for all things sea-inspired. The best way to learn about her and her work is to explore her website, jewelwing.com.

Grove’s Everyday-Carry: the Tools we Rely on Each Day in the Shop!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We
wanted to share some of the tools we use at Grove everyday to make our
items, along with some of the Grove products we ourselves enjoy daily!
Check out the product descriptions below if you’d like to learn a little
more about shop life.
From the top left going clockwise:
Grove Notebook leather Moleskine Cover in “Elephant” by Jacob Escobedo
- Here at Grove, we depend on our trusty personal Moleskine notebooks
to organize our daily ideas, to-do lists, and inspirations. Joe’s
Elephant cover has been through years of use and shows the graceful
aging of the leather, which results in a smooth texture and deep honey
hue.
Copic Multiliner Pen - This is a great pen for the detailed technical drawings essential to product and production designing.
The trusty no. 2 pencil
- A good no. 2 pencil never fails you whether you’re sketching on the
work table or working through some figures in your notebook.
Olfa Safety Cutter
- We entrust our various cutting jobs in this safe, sharp blade. It
cuts leather, veneer, paper, and other materials with ease - it’s the
sword of the workshop!
Gingher Thread Nippers - This nifty scissor-like tool is used for trimming the thread after we sew our covers for Bamboo iPad Cases, Wool iPad Sleeves, or leather Moleskine covers.
INSIZE Digital Calipers
- We like to perfect the fit of our iPhone cases, and this digital
caliper allows us to do just that. We bow down to its preciseness!
Grove Wool iPad Sleeve and Apple iPad
- We love DJing during our woodshop hours with the iPad, and the wool
sleeve is great for protecting the tablet when we carry it from our
woodshop to our laser studio and everywhere in between.
Grove SkateBack and Apple iPhone 4s
- We like to be uber cool with SkateBack-endowed iPhones; the SkateBack
is also great for protecting our phones from being set down on various
hard surfaces all day. Of course, we use our iPhones for just about
everything from Instragramming to planning super serious business
meetings. Shh!
Assorted Dental Tools - We know it’s kind of creepy, but dental tools are great for picking the excess glue off of bezels on our Bamboo iPhone cases (and the food out of our teeth after lunch...)
DEWALT Safety Glasses - Saving eyes (and making us look sexy in the workshop) since 1920!
Custom Finishing Tongs
- We crafted these tongs to be the ideal tool for our custom, hand-applied oil finishing process. We design and make many of our own tools!
3M Respirator - We use 3M respirators to add that post-apocalyptic vibe to the woodshop and to protect our lungs from the inevitable sandstorms
created by sanding up all that lovely bamboo. Ahh - breath in that
delicious wood smell - as long as you’ve got your respirator on!
We
hope you enjoyed learning a little more about our everyday tools of the
trade. We love what we do, and we love finding the right tools for each
job - even if that means we have to make them ourselves!

Mac Rumor Roundup: Summer Sales and a Fresh New iPad TV Ad!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
This
August, Apple is trying to spread the love for some of its newest iOS
devices. With Apple refurbishing programs and price-matching promotions,
the opportunity to finally get the New iPad or an iPhone 4/4s has
presented itself. Apple also premiered the following television
commercial for the New iPad on August 7th, as reported by MacRumors:
The ad states:
“Read it. Tweet it.
Be surprised. Be productive.
Make a sale. Make some lunch.
Make it movie night.
Play a game. Or an old favorite.
Do it all more beautifully, with the Retina display, on iPad.”
It’s
true that so much can be done on the New iPad, and the Retina display
adds smoothness, seamlessness, and eye-catching sharpness to so many of
our daily routines. For those without the new iPad, Apple has just begun
selling a variety of refurbished New iPads on their online store.
According to TUAW
(The Unofficial Apple Weblog), quantities of Apple refurbs are
typically limited. Each refurb comes with a complete warranty, new outer
shell, and new battery.
Apple
has also begun to price match certain retailers discounts on the
iPhone. Historically, the Apple store sticks to its own price scale;
however, MacRumors and TUAW
reported that they will accept price matching for the iPhone 4 and 4s
for Best Buy, Carriers, Radio Shack, Target, and Sprint. Allegedly,
customers must cite the source of the price to receive price matching
and can only use price matching in Apple stores, not through the online
store.
There
you have it! It’s truly Apple August, and some of us on team Grove are
especially excited to take part! Beating the heat with some indoor
tech-time sounds good right about now...

Meet Tommy, One of Grove&#39;s Original Six!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
To
customers, Tommy is probably best known for writing most of the thank
you notes for our outgoing orders, but around here Tommyhawk is known
for making sure every product gets finished and goes out on time. He’s
worked at Grove for two years and when he joined the company it was just
a baby beginner with six employees! He’s mastered every job in the
laser shop, and now his main responsibilities include lasering all the
artwork and processing all of the shipping orders. His favorite products
are the Leather Notebook Covers for Moleskine. Have a peep!
Tommy is a born-and-raised Portland native who grew up in the St John’s neighborhood.
He attended the University of Oregon where he graduated in 2009 with
Bachelors of Architecture. Out of all the Grovers who attended of the U
of O, he is the reluctant Duck.
Having grown up here, Tommy’s love of Portland fed into his desire to
become a city planner. This year he’ll be returning to school at
Portland State University for his Masters in Civil Engineering. He’s
interested in using European models of city layout-- particularly
transportation systems-- as a way to connect communities. The dude has
lived in Denmark, speaks Swedish and he’s looks forward to returning to
live and study in Copenhagen. Jealous!
Outside
of work, Tommy is an avid runner. &nbsp;Recently, he’s been getting back
into screen printing and watercoloring. &nbsp;He is also the local horror
movie buff with Suspiria at the top of his list. (Halloween is a close follow up.) &nbsp;
When he’s not keeping a small mountain of orders to be shipped and organized you can usually find him singing karaoke-- Heartbreaker by Mariah Carey!
Written
by Mike Schultz. He is an oil painter from Ithaca, New York. &nbsp;When he
is not working for Grove, he’s painting and drawing to his heart’s
content. &nbsp;You can see his work on his blog and his website.

Ten Reasons to Buy a Grove Notebook Refillable Moleskine® Cover!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We’re on the edge of our seats with the release of our newest Grove offering: Grove Notebooks. We created these refillable leather covers in both black and tan to slide snugly onto Moleskine® large and pocket-sized notebooks.
Notebooks
are precious keepers of our thoughts and inspirations - our leather
covers help protect your best doodle, next big idea, or the beginning of
that book you’ve always wanted to write. Not to mention, they keep
notebooks lookin’ snazzy and can be engraved with one of our artist
series designs or your own custom image!
Need more reasons to have a Grove Notebook cover all your own? Here’s ten:
They’re reusable, so even if you fill a Moleskine® notebook every day, we got you covered (pun alert)!
Striving
for top quality and social responsibility, we use all-natural leather
tanned here in the USA with natural bark tannins - free of harmful
chromium.
You
can support the artistic community by purchasing one of our artist
series designs and enjoy some amazing art on a daily basis while you’re
at it.
Because
the design is engraved into the leather, it’s just as long-lasting as
the cover itself. They age beautifully and develop character over time.
You
can totally get a custom order with your pug’s face engraved on the
front and your mom’s on the back - or vice versa depending on your
priorities.
Custom
Notebooks make great gifts for companies, wedding parties, family
reunions, book clubs, and yodeling circles - you name it.
Functionality
is enhanced with a slot in the front for business cards and one in the
back for usage of the Moleskine® elastic strap.
Our
leather is flexible yet durable, and we use a double layer of leather.
No matter how many times you whip out your Moleskine to write down that
genius one-liner, your notebook’s integrity is intact and your cover
won’t loosen!
Having
a naked Moleskine® means you’re more likely to accidentally grab
someone else’s and leave yours at the coffeeshop. Then everyone will
know your secret plans to take over the world one carousel at a time.
Our
covers help you get excited about your notebook again, whatever it
means to you - new dreams, new writing, new drawings, new organizational
skills, yippee!
There you have it! We love our new Grove Notebook Moleskine® covers and we hope you do to! Check them out here on our site. They start at $39 for pocket-sized plain.

Check out the Art of Five of Grove’s Talented Team Members!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We’re
lucky here at Grove to be working amongst such talented people. From
architecture and fine art to carpentry and web programming, our team has
a lot to offer! We wanted to share the art and designs of five of our
many passionate creators:
Ellie Yi
Ellie
Yi is a hardworking production manager at Grove and also a talented
illustrator. Ellie graduated with a BFA in Graphic Illustration from the
Academy of Art University in San Francisco. She uses a range of
mediums, including charcoal, acrylic, and computer illustration.
According to Ellie, almost anything in her day-to-day life can serve as
inspiration for an image or character, but the motivation to be a better
artist is what moves her to draw. From creating playful characters to
invoking emotions in the viewer, Ellie enjoys telling stories with her
drawings. She is putting that energy toward a career in children’s book
illustration and video game character design. Ellie is available for
commissioned works.
More of Ellie’s work can be viewed on her blog.
Arty Johnstone
Arty
is a production assistant at Grove - sanding cases with care in our
woodshop. He’s also a drawing maniac who’s always got his sketchbook
out. His main mediums are acrylic, pen and ink, and prismacolor pencils,
but he’s been known to do the occasional wire sculpture. He’s
interested in working quickly and capturing loose representations of the
people, places, and objects that occupy his life. Inspirations for Arty
include impressionist paintings, pop stars, and even trash bins and
some of the more underappreciated parts of human anatomy. Arty loves the
draw his friends and spend entire weekends holed up in his studio,
beating his head against the wall about the myriad quandaries of
painting. Arty was part of a two man show at the Cock gallery in
Portland entitled “Attraction and Repulsion”.
See more work from Arty on his blog.
Mike Schultz
Mike
works as a production assistant in the Grove woodshop and is an
inspiring artist returning from a 15-month stay on the Thai-Burma
border. Japanese sumi ink and oil painting are his preferred mediums.
He’s made a wide breadth of work including a collaboration with
photographer Sarah Wilmer of some haunting album art for the mysterious Connie Converse.
Since returning to the US, he has been concentrating on narrative work
reflecting his experience of living and working in a conflict zone.
While living in Mae Sot, Thailand, Mike taught art to Burmese migrant
youth and helped to establish the Puzzlebox Art Studio, a project of the Mae Sot based NGO Youth Connect. The first project of the Puzzlebox was to build a guesthouse from the ground up! Check it out here: Picture Book Guesthouse. Mike is available for commissioned works!
See some of Mike’s work and his process blog here.
Sean Michael Kelly
Sean
Kelly is production manager and product designer at Grove, and he’s
also passionate about his personal design projects. Sean creates a range
of designs - mostly furniture and consumer products. His focus is on
user experience. Growing up with a carpenter father and architect
grandfather, he’s inspired by people and how they interact with the
objects around them. Sean loves to explore the emotions that people
experience around products and why people choose to surround themselves
with certain items. One of his designs is a device that would provide an
entirely new form of communication based on movement and light!
Creating something from scratch and sharing new ideas with the world
inspires Sean in his work. &nbsp;Sean will be showing a design at the
upcoming ShowPDX , and he recently helped assemble an outdoor bamboo sculpture in Las Vegas with BambooDNA. &nbsp;His work has also been featured in PlyDesign: 73 Distinctive DIY Projects in Plywood. Sean is available for freelance, collaborative, and commissioned projects.
See more of Sean’s work on his website.
Max Brown
Max
works as a designer here at Grove, and in his personal time, creates
solid-lined and colorful comic-style tidbits. Max works mainly with
pencil and paper, Illustrator, and Photoshop. He’s inspired by other
comic and poster artists like Geof Darrow, Hergé, and Tyler Stout; but, most of all, he’s inspired by the animated show Adventure Time.
Max loves visually manifesting anything he can dream up - he sees some
storytelling coming up in his next project. Done with searching for the
perfect fictional worlds, Max has decided he’s going to have to create
them himself. Recently, Max has been working on his ongoing series of
illustrations inspired by every David Cronenberg film (in chronological
order), and has also completed a screen-printed poster for the Holiday
Friends July tour. He enjoys poster work and is free for commissioned
projects.
See his comic work at Computers are Crazy and explore his world on his website.
These
are just a few of the amazing people working on the gifted Grove team!
We’re so glad to be able to share their beautiful creations.

See How SkateBacks Are Made!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
I know we’re biased, but we think SkateBacks
are pretty darn cool. We love the colors, the feel, the look, and the
sustainability factor of using recycled SkateBoard materials! We partner
with skateboard jewelry maker MapleXO
to get our paws on this awesome material, and it’s pretty exciting to
take stuff designated as waste and make something cool and useful.
We
wanted to showcase some photos of the process of making our SkateBacks.
This product of ours starts off as waste material at Paul Schmitt’s
skateboard manufacturing shop, PS Stix. &nbsp;Lindsay, owner and founder of
MapleXO, is an expert at slicing, dicing, and matching up the material
to create strong, beautiful colorscapes.
Once
the material comes to us at the Grove workshop, it’s time to use our
high-tech machines to cut out the shape of each individual SkateBack and
to add the perfectly aligned holes for the camera. After that, we apply
the adhesive by hand, sand each piece by hand, and carefully rub an
oil-based finish on each SkateBack to bring out the best in the
material.
Our
laser completes the final steps on each SkateBack, adding our tiny
Grove + MapleXO logo at the bottom - two names carved together like it’s
true love. Grove and MapleXO sitting in a tree...
SkateBacks are available in three color types from our website!

3 Things We Love About Portland!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Some
of us grew up here and some of us migrated here-- but we all agree that
we love Portland, OR. This week we wanted to share a couple of the
things that we cherish the most about our fair city. An informal survey
of my esteemed co-workers led to these top three reasons why they like
living here.
1. The Close Proximity to Nature
If
you enjoy spending time in the natural world, all you have to ask is
what you’d like to do and go do it. Portland is situated on the
convergence of two rivers. &nbsp;Living here we are a hop, skip and a jump
away from the Pacific Ocean, the Oregon high desert, the Cascade mountain range, and old growth forests like Opal Creek. &nbsp;Wahoo!
2. Abundant Brunch Places
Here
in Portland people love a brunch-- so much so that they willingly line
up for hours on Saturday and Sunday mornings to wait for some of the
tastiest food around. Portland boasts an incredible culture of food carts,
restaurants, coffee houses, donut shops, and cafes-- where you can get
anything from greasy hangover-curing ensembles to light and tasty whole
food cuisine. Our favorite hot spot include the likes of The Tin Shed Garden Cafe, Voodoo Donuts, and Jam! Mmmm...
3. Best Biking!
One
of the things that people seem to know about Portland is that we enjoy a
vibrant bicycle culture. Everyday, many of us get exercise, get to know
our neighborhoods better, and enjoy the fresh outdoor air by riding our
bikes. Portland’s version of the World Naked Bike Ride attracts 10,000+ people to the event each year. That’s a lot of nude cyclists! Another favorite summer ride is the Bridge Pedal, a 40 mile ride that loops around the city allowing thousands of people to ride over all ten of our beautiful bridges.

We’re
so excited to work with the talented Nikki McClure on a new Artist
Series Bamboo iPad Case featuring her breathtaking piece “Mendocino”! Nikki’s heartfelt design “Mother” is already featured in our Bamboo iPhone Case Artist Series.
An
artist of the Pacific Northwest, Nikki McClure lives and makes art in
Olympia, Washington. Nikki creates intricate and beautiful paper cuts
using an X-acto knife and single sheets of paper. &nbsp;Common themes of her
images include nature, activism, community, motherhood, and a plethora
of virtues - hard work, patience, and appreciation for family and simple
pleasures. Her work often depicts celebratory scenes of everyday life: a
toolbox, a flock of birds, someone gardening, a woman laying in the
grass, a family going for a swim.
Nikki
is a veteran of the Riot Grrrl rock movement and has been involved with
Olympia record labels K and Kill Rock Stars. She continues to produce
her paper cut images on posters, cards, albums, t-shirts, and a yearly
calendar. She has also worked on many award-winning books for adults and
children through Abrams and Sasquatch, among other publishers. Cutting Her Own Path, a look at the past 16 years of Nikki McClure’s work, opens at the Bellevue Art Museum in Nov. 2012. See more about her at NikkiMcClure.com and purchase her work through Buy Olympia.
“Mendocino" will be available for $20 off this week only!

Mike D - The Phantom Menace
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
When you order custom made artwork to be engraved onto a leather iPad case, we turn to one man... the infamous Mike D. aka The Phantom. Some say he looks like Ross from Friends. &nbsp;Mostly, he dialogs with our customers about what they would like their iPad case to look like, prepares and readies the artwork for the process, and then uses our fancy lasers to engrave the cases.
Mike
was born and raised in Portland, OR. &nbsp;He attended the University of
Colorado in Boulder and graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering.
He
grew up working in his family’s restaurant, The High Hat-- which proved
to be good preparation for long periods of traveling and working around
the world. Trotting the globe, he’s been to Australia and Costa Rica,
and lived in South London with four Australians-- working concessions
and bartending for random events which enabled him to spend time in
Rome, Venice, Greece and Ireland. Living the good life!
After
he returned from traveling, Mike realized his true calling in the arts
and went back to school at the University of Oregon in the Applied Arts
and Architecture program for his BFA in Product Design. He then interned
for Grove co-founder Joe’s first business Engrave, and the rest is
history.
When he’s not lurking in the shadows on Wendy’s computer or chilling out with his special lady friend watching a good movie, you can probably find Mike rocking his indoor soccer league - having fun and keeping in good shape. &nbsp;Yeah!

Mac Rumors: the iPad Mini
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
While
some sources are weighing in on the specifications of the rumored iPad
mini, others are rolling their eyes and declaring that the miniature
tablet is make-believe. Cult of Mac
acknowledged rumors that Apple will unveil the iPad mini this fall, and
that the device will sport a non-Retina 1024×768 display.
Mac Rumors reported on photos found by Gotta Be Mobile of the alleged mini’s size specs. &nbsp;
Gotta Be Mobile stated:
“What
we’ve found, using a pixel count, is that the iPad Mini should be
around 213.36mm tall and about 143.67mm wide. This is approximately
two-thirds of the size of the new third-generation iPad. The new iPad is
185.67mm wide, 241.3mm tall, and 9.39mm thick.
“Google’s
Nexus 7 tablet has a width of 120mm which means that the iPad Mini, if
our calculations are close, might be around 23.67mm wider than the Nexus
7. The Nexus 7 tablet measures in at 198.5mm high which means that the
iPad Mini may be a little taller than Google’s 7-inch tablet.”
Cult of Mac
also posted a visual breakdown of the proposed screen size of the iPad
mini compared with other tablets on the market. The graphic shows the
iPad mini filling the gap between 7-inch tablets and the full-sized
iPad.
Daring Fireball
speculates that a large motivation for the release will be to offer a
lower price point model for Apple devotees. Unlike other smaller
tablets, Fireball writer John Gruber feels the iPad mini would go for a
low price point between $200 and $300 instead, effectively creating a
new niche for itself.
Gruber writes: &nbsp;
“...by
introducing the iPad Mini with a non-retina display but a lower price,
it would instantly establish which product is the “best” (iPad (3)) and
which is the low-cost model (iPad Mini). In this way, I envision the
iPad/iPad Mini relationship being very different from the iPod/iPod Mini
one, where the two products were nearly evenly priced and you chose
between storage capacity (iPod) and device size/weight (iPod Mini).”
Photo from Cult of Mac
In the meantime, The Unofficial Apple Weblog
(TUAW) is sticking to its guns and barely covering the rumored mini
tablet at all - except to say that it isn’t real. The TUAW crew seems to
find the iPad mini issue quite humorous, writing, “Because fighting for
the low-end market is totally something Apple does. Ever. *cough*.”
TUAW wraps up the issue:
“Until
[its release] happens -- if it ever happens -- there is no way I will
believe this product exists. And despite the fact that I don't really
see any plausible economic reason for Apple to make one, I still kind of
hope they do introduce something like an iPad mini just so the rumor
blogs will finally shut up about it.”
Here
at Grove, we’re on the fence about the mini, but (in the words of The
Voice from a beloved baseball classic), “If you build it, they will
come.”
What do you think? Is this new device destined for the market?

Grove Buzz: SkateBacks Cause a Flurry
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We,
here, at Grove were overwhelmed (lots of high fives, giggles, and hugs)
by the coverage we received for the launch of our latest product,
available in three variations: Calm, Neutral, and Vibrant. &nbsp;As chatter about our SkateBacks
spread throughout cyberspace, we were excited and so grateful to see
that news of the SkateBack launch was picked up by major media platforms
and online magazines (links on product page).&nbsp;
We
were deemed “Gnarly” (thanks, Gizmodo!) and “environmentally friendly”
by MacRumors who also, rightly, mentioned that our SkateBacks weren’t
primarily a protective case, but an add-on that provides a unique and
fun look to the iPhone.
Undeniably, new interest was sparked in curious iPhone users and Apple enthusiasts around the country thanks to MacRumors, Digital Trends, Hypebeast, Gizmodo, and Uncrate.
&nbsp;Most of the articles highlighted the fact that we employ
post-industrial skateboard scraps that would otherwise end up as waste
“enough to fill a school bus,” with a simple adhesive that allows the
SkateBack to be conveniently applied to the back of the iPhone for
instant personality. &nbsp;
However, it was our faithful Grove fans that truly impressed us, yet again! Blowing us away with outspoken enthusiasm on our Facebook page,
and also in replies to articles that popped up all over the internet.
We were also very touched by the fierce loyalty that we experienced when
you rushed to defend us with your support to skeptics.
It’s because of you that we say, “We have the best customers!” Grove on!

The Color Orange, the Number 7, and a Lion: Welcome to San’s World!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
This
week we wanted to introduce you to one of our fantastic production
assistants, San. &nbsp;He’s on team quality control-- spending his days
inspecting each iPhone case with care before packing them up to be
shipped out to our loyal customers. &nbsp;Mainly he works with QC team leader
Ellie in the laser shop, and is a great addition to our team.
San
hails from sunny Beaverton, Oregon and graduated from Portland
Community College with an associates degree in art. &nbsp;In college he was
heavy into music theory, and now works at his church as the Worship
Director-- playing the guitar and leading the service every Sunday.
When
he is working in the shop you can catch him listening to an eclectic
mix of musicians like Skrillex, Jay-Z, Ke$ha and folk artist Mat
Kearney.
San’s
hobbies include working out, playing music, watching great movies, and
supporting some of Portland’s local sports teams-- the Blazers and the
Timbers. &nbsp;Though truth be told he is a devoted fan of the New York
Knicks. Represent!
To sum it up San is a lover of the color orange, 7 is his number, and if he were a beast the man would be a lion. &nbsp;goGrove!

New Artist Series Design from Brian Yap!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We
launched a new artist series iPhone and iPad bamboo case design today
by prolific designer, illustrator, creative director, and
digital-imagery specialist Brian Yap! We’re so happy to be working with
this self-described “graphics jack-of-all-trades” and his “almost
obsessive work ethic.”
Brian
resides in Edwardsville, Illinois and is a two-time Davey Award winner
who has also won awards from The Communicator, the St. Louis Addy’s, and
the St. Louis Egoist, among other organizations. His work
is showcased yearly in the Famous and Fictional show at the Mad art
gallery in St. Louis. He’s built up a personal technique using ink pens,
scanning, and Adobe Ideas for iPad, and his work often closely calls upon
screen printing. &nbsp;An appreciation for music posters contributes to his
notable style.
Fun
and daily inspiration are at the top of Brian’s list, but he has a high
set of standards for his work. He’s devoted to design and equally
balances concept and execution. As Creative Director at Boxing Clever,
a full-service creative agency he helped form as a subsidiary of 4
Alarm Studio, he’s worked with many notable clients, such as Tuaca
Liqueur, Chambord Liqueur and Vodka, Finlandia Vodka, shell Automotive,
and more. Brian is also an adjunct professor of Art and Design at
Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. His work can be explored on brianyap.com as well as Behance and Coroflot.

Finding Portland: Some Love for Bridge City
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
There’s lots to love about Portland, and this video by Uncage the Soul Video Production
captures some of the magic of the city. It’s nice to take a step back,
even during busy times, and appreciate that we live in a truly fantastic
area. The video highlights some notable parts of PDX - from its urban
structures, mechanics, and mobilities to its active people, mountain
tops, lush foliage, and delicious offerings. Not to mention, this is
some darn good camera work!
Finding Portland from Uncage the Soul Productions on Vimeo.
Uncage
the Soul screened the video at the sold-out TEDx Convention in Portland
this April. &nbsp;Comprised of over 300,000 photographs, the team completed
the video in 51 days and shot in more than 50 unique locations
overlooking Portland. &nbsp;Specific locations and events shown include the
Fremont Bridge, the Oneonta Gorge, Mount Hood, Mount Tabor, and Mount
St. Helens, a Portland Timbers soccer game, a Blazers basketball game,
the annual Shamrock Run, Voodoo Doughnuts, Powell’s Books, the Deschutes
brewpub, and, of course, the famous White Stag sign.
Read more about the video on Vimeo or on Uncage the Soul’s project description
page, which is complete with some stills from the shoot. To those who
visit or those who live here, it’s apparent that this is a special place
to be, or (as it states at the end of the video) to roast, brew, savor,
hike, bike, travel, shop, create, love, laugh, and uncover.

&#34;Fear and Groving in Las Vegas&#34;
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Grove co-founder Ken and woodshop manager Sean recently travelled to Las Vegas to build a large bamboo sculpture for the Electric Daisy Carnival aka EDC - a huge electronic music festival which attracts roughly 345,000 people. Sean and Ken worked with Bamboo DNA, a company led by Ken’s friend and mentor Gerard Minakawa.
Bamboo
DNA “specializes in contemporary bamboo architectural and sculptural
applications” building large scale structures for festivals such as
Burning Man, Coachella, and EDC. To avoid the desert heat the seven
person team worked from 6pm to 6am under intense artificial lights for
seven nights straight. &nbsp;
“It
was amazing to see massive piles of raw bamboo material transform over
the week into a very airy, light looking sculpture” said Sean. The
highlight was the final moment of the eighty-four hour week when the
generators shut off, lights went out, and Tecate in hand they all sat
back and looked at what they had just built.
The
art structure was eighty feet tall and 170 feet in diameter, using both
modern rigging techniques and traditional knots to hold thirty-one
columns all in place. The purpose of this sculpture was to be a place of
rest and rejuvenation for festival goers.
Sean
and Ken want to thank Gerard and the Bamboo DNA badasses who they
worked with all week: Nicholas, Roman, Ryan, Fez, Luke, Laura,
Brandon and Andrew. The two lone Grovers brought their enthusiasm for
bamboo back to Portland which has inspired our shop to look at our work
in a new light. &nbsp;
