Looking Back On 2014
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Here we are, December, the month that ends the year and ushers in the next. As the year comes to a close, we invite you to take a look back with us on our journey through 2014 before we dive into 2015.
Beginning
As the calendar turned over to 2014, the new year welcomed big changes to all things Grovemade. We started with a complete overhaul of our brand and identity by introducing a sparkling new website. With the website launch, we – deep breath – said hello to Walnut and Maple, manufactured the world’s first all wood iPhone bumper, launched a brass docking station, and introduced our wood sleeve for iPad and Macbook.
Sadly, with all of the new developments came the difficult but necessary decision to discontinue our beloved Artist Series. We also enjoyed a brief respite due to our frosty foe, Snowmageddon.
Middle
Spring brought the return of the rains and heralded the birth of a yearlong dream-in-the-making, the Desk Collection. Motivated by our collective experience of drab desktops, we envisioned sleekly designed products that would give an aesthetic and ergonomic boost to any workspace. And while we were at it, we went ahead and unveiled our plans for a collaborative project that we’d dreamt of for more than a year, the Wood Watch.
During the Summer months, we tackled the backend of our business. We incorporated Kanban, FIFO, and new fulfillment systems to streamline our production capabilities as well as to improve our customers’ experience. With the Summer heat, we dreamt of conditioned air and frequently hailed the ice cream truck that jingled past our doors on more occasions than we could count. Creamsicles, anyone?
End
Autumn came in a rush, and with it the rumblings and then the confirmation of a new iPhone from Apple. Being proponents of the “fail to plan, plan to fail” axiom, our design team had already been hard at work conceptualizing a new line of cases for the next generation of iPhone. When the curtain finally opened to unveil the new phone, we were able to debut our new product line. Composed of a bumper, a full case, and a leather and wood folio for the 6 and 6 Plus, it was our most ambitious case launch to date.
The new products mandated new design concepts that opted for strength and utility, which led to the retirement of the slider case design and the discontinuation of bamboo for hardier domestic American hardwoods.
As the weather cooled, we saw steady progress on the development of all our new cases, each, of course, with its own set of unique challenges and obstacles. To recharge our batteries, we participated in a number of fun local events like Design Week Portland, Show PDX, and the Portland Bazaar to showcase our goods and connect with our local fans and customers! In the process of preparing for these meet-and-greets, it prompted us to “clean house.” We declared a war on clutter, both in our workshop and in our database. A happy shop is a clean shop! Or is it the other way around?
Looking Ahead
All in all, 2014 has been a bumper year for all of us at Grovemade. We’ve expanded our vision and taken ahold of our dreams by tackling new designs and products.  With 2015 to look forward to, we also begin our sixth year as a business. We’ve gotten here because of you, our customers, who have proven to be so much more than that. Without you, none of this is possible. We get to go to work each day because you’ve had our backs from the start when we had one product and stored our finished goods in our living rooms. You spur us on to be the best and we hope only to get better by providing you with awesomely designed products for your devices, your desktops, and your homes.

Why We Discontinued the Artist Series
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
 &#13;
 &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In February of 2014, we unveiled a new website that introduced a new direction for Grovemade. With the new website came the availability of new products, while several tried and true products were discontinued, including the Artist Series of cases. Since then, we’re frequently asked Why: Why did we no longer offer the Artist Series? Why did we move on from something so successful? Why take such a huge risk? Here’s the why.&#13;
In the early days, The Artist Series was a new concept. We were the only company to laser engrave high quality artwork onto the bamboo that composed the case. Doing so gave us a signature piece that added distinction and personalization to each device housed by our case. Fortunately for us, you were as thrilled for our product as we were, and The Artist Case became not only our most popular product but a big part of our company’s identity.&#13;
Yet, as we were riding the wave, we found that our model was being copied and reproduced. In lieu of exceptional handcrafted goods, the market was being flooded with products constructed cheaply abroad. Quantity replaced quality, and the more so as plastic cases with ‘wooden’ veneers soon entered the market. We found that dozens of companies were churning out inferior products with laser engraved artwork affixed with little to none of the care and workmanship cherished by Grovemade. With the focus on the artwork, the fact that the quality of our case itself was superior was lost in the sea of competition. The focus on artwork - the thing that once defined us - was no longer an edge, but a liability.&#13;
For a time, though, we clung to the belief that we could continue combining high quality workmanship with incredibly executed artwork. It made sense: after all, we were the only ones doing it, we had a competitive edge! It was difficult to recognize that what seemed to be working and made us unique, the very thing that we’d thought was central to our identity, was actually what was taking us down. There’s a reason why it’s almost unheard of to find a company (especially one of Grovemade’s size) that is well respected for producing high caliber goods and curating high caliber artwork on those products.  Simply put, one takes focus away from the other.&#13;
Even though we were a young company, we knew that strong companies that last need to have a strong identity. With our business rapidly declining and with gloomy forecasts ahead, we realized that we needed to get off the path towards commoditization. Doing so meant choosing a firm path of focus in order to survive.&#13;
In the end, the overwhelming hunger to bring first-rate goods to the public was our saving grace and what brought us to the present. Our case forms, our artwork, even our business model could be mimicked, but what couldn’t be reproduced were the quality of our products, the construction methods that go into each work we produce, and the hard work of the people behind the products. So, instead of fighting the flood, we cranked up the anchor and set sail in an entirely new direction.&#13;
With our new website and rebrand in February 2014, we made our move. We chose to let go of the Artist Series in order to bring the focus back to our products. Our website was redesigned to feature our story and team first and foremost, as well as to give a streamlined shopping experience for multiple product lines. This new direction was chosen with an eye focused on a future where we moved beyond Apple-based accessories, so as to become a well-respected product-driven company.  &#13;
Letting go of the Artist Series was an incredibly hard thing to do, as it meant eliminating our best-selling product. Many would think of it as business suicide. Just as difficult was the fact that in doing so, we had the potential to disappoint many of our dedicated fans. Adding to this already heavy burden was the end of our regular collaborations with the artist community itself (one that continues, happily, to thrive in Portland and beyond). Yet, we knew that this was a move we had to make to ensure Grovemade’s long-term survival, and we are grateful that it has worked out well so far.&#13;
Since February, we’ve had multiple successes in new product categories, as evidenced with the debut of our Desk Collection and the introduction of our Wood Watch. Coupling this new direction with an emphasis on size-restricted batches has allowed us to deliver consistently high quality goods while giving us energy and space to build for the future. With a diverse product line and newfound focus we are now stronger than ever.  &#13;
 &#13;
While many of our long time fans undoubtedly will miss the artists series (and we do too) our hope is that they believe in something more than a physical product, that they believe in us - our team. We’re excited as ever for the future and we hope you stick with us through the next chapter of Grovemade!&#13;

Blast From the Past
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
The arrival of autumn marks the beginning of the second spring. We’re treated to vibrant leaves and cooler air. We become reacquaintated with our rain coats and sweaters. The days shorten and tumble into more quickly into night, allowing us to view the stars that much sooner. Students, young and old, are back in school, studying, daydreaming, soaking up new ideas and coming up with their own. Time moves along, its steady flow like that of a spring fed river. In thinking of time’s forward progression, we here at Grovemade have become a bit nostalgic for those good old younger days of school and play and carefree afternoons. So much so that we’ve cracked the spines on our photo albums and blown the dust off our yearbooks for a look - a blast, rathe - into the past. Enjoy!

The Journey
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
 
How does the idea become the thing? The tangible product? How does it arrive at handcrafted exquisiteness? From raw material to our gorgeously constructed iPhone 6 cases and bumpers?
The route taken to the destination is often tortuous, pitted with holes, washed out in places. Sometimes the road does not exist at all, and tapers into a rutty earthen path. Here at Grovemade, however, we like a challenge, we like the dirt, we like molding that which comes from it.
We start with wood. High quality, domestically sourced wood. Oregon Claro Walnut and Eastern Hardrock Maple, to be specific. When a shipment arrives at our workshop in downtown Portland, Oregon, the whole team helps out to bring it in from the outside. We check over every plank to ensure each finished product is as close to perfection as humanly possible, then place them in their proper place - laser room, mill room, production shop.
 
 
With the arrival of a batch of orders, the team springs into action. The specifics are meted out, the woods selected and cut to approximate size, and are then sent to the laser shop. There, the profiles of our goods are lasered out by the Speedy 500. It’s carpentry with light, equal parts magic and ingenuity.
Next, the pieces are sent to the mills for fine detailing. The blank profile is taken further along the line. All is inspected for defects, knots, cracks, warping.  Blades whir and the journey progresses. What was once a simple wedge is now discernible as a keyboard tray in need of a shave.
 
Once out of the mill, the pieces are ready for production. A multipronged attack commences. Each piece is inspected for quality then put on the line. It is subjected to one round of sanding, then another, until the wood’s surface is as soft and plush as the premium Hermann and Oak Leather that lines our cases. After the wood dust is vanquished by a blast from the air hose, it’s ready to be hand-oiled, then set to dry for a solid twenty-four hours.
 
Lastly, the component parts are added, a final sanding ensues, another round of quality control occurs, and then after our final goodbyes, each piece is sent to the finished goods shelf. From there, the fine folks in shipping wrap each order with care in our specially made shipping containers, affix them with a stamp, and send them to you. We don’t allow for shortcuts, we don’t care for substitutes. We do it all onsite. We do it for you.

To Those Who Wait - Apples, iPhone Cases and a Look Behind the Scenes
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
 
You’ve waited. We’ve waited. We’ve defined the proverbs. We’ve lived the sayings. We’ve piled up the virtue and built several Romes. But, hey, good news! The waiting time is over and we can all breathe a little easier as iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have arrived. They’ve been introduced and we’ve been wowed. They’re gorgeous and they’re for sale today, at Apple!
Here at Grovemade, we’ve cracked open our piggy bank just for this momentous occasion! Not only do we want them for the incredible design and top notch communication applications but also because we want to swaddle them in hand-oiled Walnut and Maple and premium grade, vegetable-tanned leather cases.
The new iPhone 6 demands (really, it told us this in no uncertain terms) that it wants to be clothed in only the best cases available. Happily for the iPhone and for you, we happen to produce some of the very finest cases and bumpers designed especially for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Featuring classic craftsmanship, cutting edge design and custom quality construction, our new line of cases are works of iPhone protecting art. Did we mention that we’re taking orders now and greasing the gears of our people-powered production machine?
Thinking of all these new things has moved us to reflective mode - just how did we get to our most current cases. Like, what went into the design, the construction, the everything? Unlike Isaac Newton, an apple didn’t fall on all of our heads at the same time, triggering a spontaneous and synchronized eureka for team Grovemade, specs and all. Nope, if we peeled back the tape, we’d see that nearly five years of continuous thought, revision and prototyping went into our new products!
When we learned that a new iPhone was coming down the pike, we definitely knew that we wanted to change the design of our cases fundamentally. But doing so proved to be difficult. It wasn’t until we were finetuning our current iPad case that we realized we could do the same thing with our next iPhone case. Quoth our very own Barrett: “We can do this for iPhone!” That’s why you’ll find that our famed slider frame has been replaced with a soon to be famous single, seamless frame.
 
 
This design amplifies the natural flexibility of the wood and lets you put in and remove your phone without putting extra stress on the wood. We’ve also used our additive design principles to increase the core strength of the frame, using precision corner joints to ensure that we get the most out of the wood and that you get a durable and strong case or bumper.
We also wanted to make the overall case thinner. Way back when, we started with a single piece of wood and carved down. Very reductive, very time-consuming and very not the way we like doing things. Happily, we’ve learned a ton since ‘09, and now offer a self-adhering back plate composed of a single piece of wood that’s all of 0.070 inches thick.
And, after many, many prototypes and rejections, yeses, nos and maybes, we arrived at what the elegant cases you see now. They didn’t happen overnight but thanks to our ethos of teamwork and our willingness to learn from previous processes, they came to be naturally. That’s the Grovemade way!

Grovemade Unveils New iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus Cases!!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
The esteemed craftsman George Nakashima once said that each plank of wood can have only one ideal use, and that it’s up to the woodworker to find that use. Once found, the woodworker’s duty is to create from that one plank an object of utility. When he’s finished, if nature looks upon it and finds it made well, he’ll know he’s created an object of beauty.
Since 2009, we’ve been moving and shaking to the drumbeat of utility and the bass line of beauty by producing some of the loveliest, most thoughtfully designed hand-assembled wooden accessories on the market.
We take pride in producing everything in-house. All the work takes place in our workshop nestled here in Portland, Oregon – from the concepts dreamt up by our designers to the fine woodworking done by our millers to the finishing touches applied by our production team.
 
 
It’s truly a unified team effort to take that roughshod plank of wood to a functional piece of hardware for your high tech gear and accessories. Over the past six months, we’ve been hard at work designing, testing, designing some more, fashioning prototypes and finalizing three brand new cases to compliment the release of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
We’re excited, proud and simply tickled to introduce this new line. Not only are they visually stunning, showcasing hand-oiled Oregon Claro Walnut and Eastern Hardrock Maple, they’re also our thinnest and most durable cases to date.
 
 
Our additive design process ensures that the materials we employ are used for their best qualities. That’s to say that we build around the device to ensure that each case fits your device like a glove to the hand.
 
These cases are seamlessly constructed and feature our signature precision corner joints for increased strength and protection. They combine a full screen cover of premium vegetable-tanned leather with an ultra-thin (we’re talking an 0.070 inches kind of ultra-thin) self-adhering back plate. Our bumper features the only all-wood frame on the market and adds a healthy splash of style. Beyond superior protection, we’ve expanded our vision to include increased versatility – the wood and leather case also doubles as a stand for easy-peasy video viewing.
 
 
Just as the iPhone has been evolving constantly in dimensionality and its applications, Grovemade has been changing and adapting to bring you the best user experience possible.

Hey, Running Man!!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Our longstanding Grovemade team member Scott is a man of many talents. For years he’s been our workshop impresario. By bringing his trademark efficiency and do-it-allness to the Grovemade shop floor, Scott’s more than earned the title of The Ultimate Handyman. Outside of the office, he features as a metropolitan mountain man who homesteads in the urban wilds of his backyard. When he’s not in his garden or shepherding his goats, you just might spot Scott sprinting up the winding streets of Portland.
You see, for Scott, running is more than just a way to stay fit – it’s nature’s finest form of transportation. Running is a mobile dream shop that allows him to conjure up excellent new designs while darting from point A to point B to point C. It’s his personal bus ride to work, a leisurely car ride to the countryside and a free cabbie ride home from the pub, where he’s known, fondly, as “Hey, Running Man!”
Because of Scott’s enthusiasm for using his body as an engine and his feet as wheels, he’s been chosen as one of five featured runners in the Kickstarter-funded documentary “What Moves You.”
Combining the stories of everyday athletes from across the country with breathtaking cinematic videography, “What Moves You” aspires to weave together the tales and experiences of runners from all walks of life and skill levels. The film delves into the social, biological and cultural forces that drive them to the roads, sidewalks and dusty trails. It seeks that elusive common denominator – the reason behind the run.
So, to check out Grovemade’s very own Crazy Scott and to support an awesome documentary film project, swing on over to their Kickstarter page. While there, we hope you check out the preview of Scott’s chapter, The Urban Farmer Hipster! After viewing it, it could be you who’s running to work!

Moment Lens: A Friend of Grovemade!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We love to make friends with and explore the ins and outs of other companies that align with our business philosophy! Today, we wanted to introduce Moment, a fellow company making beautiful products for mobile photography. Their Moment Lenses attach to your phone (iPhone, Galaxy, and Nexus) and capture gorgeous photos with everyone's most handy camera - the phone.

As a company, Moment's purpose is, "Empowering people to share more beautiful moments." The Lens allows users to truly live in the moment and take photographs on-the-go that are astoundingly beautiful. It attaches securely to the iPhone with or without a case, and it works wonderfully with our Grovemade Bumper.

“We are a collection of builders who believe that the future of photography is in our pockets,” says Moment, on their site. Sound familiar? At Grovemade, we also like to consider ourselves a collection of makers, which puts us in a similar camp of team-based manufacturing.
 
On their blog, you can see Moment’s founder, Marc Barros responded directly to customers who comment on posts or have questions about shipping. It’s refreshing to see such transparency and efficiency! Read their latest update on their blog to see how the glass from the lens is made and learn about the exciting shipment stage of their pre-orders.

Another good read is the company’s blog post “How It’s Made - The Art Of Manufacturing”. A little bit of their story follows:
 
“We started Moment last August with some big ideas and a few sketches in a notebook. Working through dozens of prototypes and production samples, we can’t tell you how excited we are to be manufacturing our first units. This phase of the design process is by far the most tedious, making it extremely exhausting. However, it’s this stage in the game that can make or break the final quality of your product.”

The Moment Lens is a great product if you’re like the many people taking photos with a smartphone everyday. Make your photos be everything you hope them to be! We highly recommend it. And, if you purchase it, take comfort knowing you’re supporting a hard working company run by wonderful people. Follow them on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, and don’t forget to check out their blog!

New Limited Edition Brass + Maple Dock
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We’re excited to introduce an all new Brass + Maple Dock for iPhone. A limited edition of just 50 individually serialized pieces, this very well may be the golden child of the Grovemade iPhone Dock family.
 
 
It’s the bright and sunny antidote to a boring, cluttered desk or nightstand. The solid brass base weighs just over three pounds, allowing you to plug and unplug your phone using only one hand, just like our original “sooo heavy” dock. We get our brass milled by our friends nearby, here in Oregon. And, we craft the cap from all natural Eastern Hardrock Maple; our team sands and oils each piece by hand here in our workshop.
 
 
 
Priced at $149, the Brass + Maple Dock for iPhone is compatible with iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5S + 5C. Be sure to make your purchase before supplies run out!

Life at Grovemade: Part 1 (Photos by William Anthony)
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We recently had our friend, photographer William Anthony, pay a visit to Grovemade and snap some photographs of our team in its natural environment. He got some beautiful shots and shared them with us -- because he’s rad -- so, we can use them to help us continue to tell our story.
 
The photo above is a bird’s eye view of our Monday morning meeting, right before we tidy up and start our week. We value the ability to have a team-wide check-in every week, to keep us feeling cohesive at work. We talk about what we did that weekend, as well as what we’re planning on working on that week. Getting to know each other helps us feel like a family; we love hearing about Dashia’s son’s basketball tournaments, Sean’s love for every movie ever made, Galen’s addiction to ramen, and Ken’s strange obsession with power-washing his mother’s deck.
 
 
We are a pretty silly bunch. But, there’s nothing silly about taking out the trash! Right after our team meeting, we begin our timed, 5-minute weekly clean-up. We sweep, water the plants, clean each other’s computer screens, take out the garbage, and gather up the nerf balls and darts hidden under desks and in corners. The key sentiment is we do it together. No chore chart, just everyone working together. We like starting the week with a fresh studio and also the mental clean slate that comes along with getting your hands a little dirty with the team.
Then, it’s off to making things. Since we see them everyday, we forget our tools are truly beautiful objects, due both to their usefulness and to their precise shapes. And precise tools are necessary in our shop; so much hard work and concentration goes into perfecting each and every iPhone case going through our team’s hands, from milling to sanding to hand oiling.
 
 
Thank you for the photos, William! We love when our creative friends visit. And, it’s all the more exciting when we get to have some beautiful photographs to show for it! We’ll be sharing more of William’s photos periodically on our blog and Instagram.
 
Don’t forget to check out William Anthony’s work on his website, Tumblr, Instagram, and VSCO Grid!

Introducing The Limited Edition Black Dock
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We’ve made our most heavy metal product yet: a limited edition dock for iPhone with a sexy black aluminum cap. It’s the James Bond of iPhone Docks. (Sean Connery or Daniel Craig, not Pierce Brosnan; No offense, Pierce, but you’re more of a Walnut Dock type.)  Combined with a solid brass, silver steel, or black steel base, the Black Dock is our first entirely metal product. We have 50 available in brass, 100 in silver steel, and 100 in black steel, each engraved with its unique serial number. And, if you’re wondering about the endless benefits of owning a Grovemade Dock for iPhone, read all about that here!  The black matte coating on the aluminum cap is the same durable coating used on premium knives; it’s more durable than anodizing. You choose the base in solid brass, silver solid steel, or black solid steel. The base combined with the metal cap weighs over three pounds (more than our wood dock!) and allows you to plug and unplug your phone using only one hand. We’re expecting they might fly off the shelves (so we’re ducking, because OUCH)! Get yours now. The Dock is compatible with iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5S + 5C and includes our new and improved cord adapter.  The introductory prices for the Black Dock are $119 for the silver steel and black steel base and $149 for the solid brass base. Written by Mary Yajko.

The New York Times Features Our Birdhouse
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
“Modernist Birds Can Roost Here,” states the title of the small article in Thursday, June 12th’s issue of the New York Times.  We’ve crafted a limited run of handcrafted birdhouses for your avian friends with discernable taste. This sturdy, two-piece house is made from hand-sanded birch and black walnut and finished with a waterborne protectant, the same kind used on wooden boats. The precise lasercut pattern on the front panel camouflages the entrance while providing a modern take on the appearance of a nest.  Even though it was a very limited run of birdhouses, we were happy to be featured in the Times’ Home section. And of course, with the existence of the phrase “Put a bird on it!”, the article wouldn’t have been complete without writer Linda Lee asking our co-owner Joe Mansfield a question about Portlandia:  “Grovemade’s wood iPhone case has already appeared in the cult TV series ‘Portlandia.’ If that show were to do a full-bore Grovemade parody, what product would be required? ‘I guess they’d have us make a high-end bike-polo stick,’ Mr. Mansfield said. ‘It’s all the rage in Portland.’" You can read the full article online here. And, let us know on Twitter (@Grovemade) or Facebook if you’d like us to make more birdhouses in the future!Written by Mary Yajko.

Apple Rumors XTREME: Bendy, Stab-Proof iPhones Built by Robots
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Whether or not they end up being true, Apple rumors can get pretty ridiculous -- especially as Apple fanboys gear up for an upcoming iPhone release. We wanted to gather some of the more colorful (yet, still somewhat plausible!) rumors we’ve seen floating around the blogosphere. Prepare yourself for an iPhone 6 built for you by robots, with a bendable screen made from sapphire, that can survive repeated stabs with a knife without sustaining a single scratch!   Bendy ScreenSonny Dickson, frequent iOS parts leaker, recently posted two videos online showing himself bending the alleged sapphire display of the iPhone 6. Despite being paperthin, the screen withstands some fairly extreme bends at the hands of Dickson. Of course, the average iPhone 6 user will never bend their screen, since it will be attached to the body of the phone when it’s actually in use. However, the flexibility of the screen is a good indicator of how well the screen will be able to survive drops and impacts. The more flexible the screen, the more resilient it should be, and the less prone to shatter. Read more about the bendy screen here: http://www.macrumors.com/2014/07/07/iphone-6-front-panel-bend/   Stab-ProofMarques Brownlee, a tech video host on YouTube, took it a couple steps further than the bend-test with the sapphire iPhone 6 display. Not only does he bend it more than Sonny Dickson, but he also sets out to try to scratch the surface of the display using keys and a knife. He really puts some elbow grease in, even going so far as to repeatedly stab the front of the screen with the knife using a good amount of force. The screen comes out of the experience without a single scratch. Brownlee hypothesizes that he might be able to break it by dropping a heavy rock onto it. Again, we aren’t able to drop-test the screen until it’s attached to the body of the phone. However, these tests do point to higher durability for the iPhone 6. Read more about stabbing the iPhone 6 here: http://9to5mac.com/2014/07/07/sapphire-4-7-iphone-6-display-put-through-its-paces-with-knife-and-keys-in-new-scratch-test-video/ RobotsIn addition to hiring 100,000 new employees to work on the new Apple iPhone 6, Foxconn is reportedly bringing in 10,000 “Foxbot” robots to join its team. These are Foxconn’s own robot design -- costing the company about $20K to $25K each to make -- which Apple will be the first to try out on the making of its iPhones. Macrumors gives more detail about the robots:“According to the paper, the assembly robots will be used for less intensive tasks such as tightening screws and positioning exterior components for polishing. Foxconn factory employees will still be responsible for more important tasks such as quality control and general assembly, however the company expects its robots to help greatly with device yield and output.” Read more about robots making iPhones here:http://www.macrumors.com/2014/07/09/foxconn-robots-supporting-role/ The new iPhone 6 is expected to be announced in September, and will likely come in a 4.7-inch version and a 5.5-inch version. A thinner profile is also likely, along with a possibly improved camera and faster processor. We’re so excited to build the best iPhone 6 case we can, after it’s announced by Apple! Written by Mary Yajko. She is a copywriter and member of Team Grove originally from upstate New York.

Forbes Calls Grovemade “A Workshop With World Reach”
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Forbes magazine’s Hester Lacey recently interviewed our team for an article titled “Workshop With World Reach: How To Turn A Craft Product Into A Global Brand” on Forbes.com. The article highlights our co-founder Ken Tomita’s descriptions of what makes our company unique and successful by our own standards. Read below for some key quotes from the article, and check out the full write-up here on Forbes. Forbes: “When friends Ken Tomita and Joe Mansfield founded Grovemade in 2009, they set out to marry their artisanal skills with some seriously high-tech products. Grovemade’s tech accessories, beautifully hand-made out of natural wood, are compatible with Apple’s latest products. Monitor stands and mouse pads, along with a range of deskware, complement the Apple-compatible range and Grovemade is also adding wooden watches to its line.”  Grovemade co-founder Ken Tomita Ken: “From my background as a furniture designer, my goal was to bring the warmth of tradition into modern design and that’s extended into Grovemade. People are worried about getting just one scratch on their phones: you open the packaging to find a perfect product, but plastic doesn’t improve as it ages, where natural materials get better with age. I can have as many Grovemade cases as I want but I like my old one! That contrast is really resonates with customers. You have to do it the right way, though. Most consumer goods are mass-produced wood with plastic coatings. We do a hand-rubbed oil finish, you can still feel and touch the wood.” Ken: “My favourite part of our production is the finish. We sand away burrs, then hand rub with natural oils. That brings up the gleam and protects the wood – and is the point where the product really starts to shine. We work on very small batches, with the same people seeing the whole process through, and the crew pushes so hard for quality.” Grovemade co-founder Joe MansfieldKen: “We can do things that are really hard, things where a factory would just say ‘no’. Factories are businesses: they’re designed to make money, not do hard things.[..] We were successful because we chose to differentiate, be better and be ourselves, which made us better. Don’t compete on price or quantity: be better, whatever that means for you. Be better, be different and be yourself.”Our thanks go out to Hester Lacey for her kind words about Grovemade and for featuring us on Forbes.

Chris King’s Visit to Grovemade
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Chris King recently featured us on Cielo Cycle’s Buzz blog, in a post titled, “Like-Minded: A Tour of Grovemade”. Cielo Cycles is a fellow Portland manufacturer working in world-class handmade bicycle fabrication. An arm of Chris King Precision Components, Cielo Cycles creates handmade, small-batch bicycle frames of the absolute highest quality. Chris King began manufacturing frames and bicycle components in 1978, and the company prides itself on integrity, precision, design, and reliability.
 
We enjoyed having their team visit our workshop. Sharing our processes and space with a company we hold in high regard is a great experience. They took some gorgeous photos and made some wonderful comments on the way we do things here. It’s definitely a blog post worth checking out! Here are some highlights from the post:
 
Image source: http://cielo.chrisking.com/2014/06/18/like-minded-a-tour-of-grovemade/
 
 
"Out of this fertile community companies have risen that address the party line that 'manufacturing is dead in the US,' head-on with an explicit show-don’t-tell attitude. One such business is Portland manufacturer Grovemade, makers of modern and sophisticated wood based office supplies and personal electronic accessories. Their products are designed and produced in their SE Portland facility where they maintain a strict focus on both the quality of their product and the environmental impact of their production."
 
Image source: http://cielo.chrisking.com/2014/06/18/like-minded-a-tour-of-grovemade/
 
“[...]Grovemade has continued to expand their offerings,” states Cielo, “drawing design inspiration from Alvar Aalto sparse wood textures and Dieter Ram’s functional fineness of line.”
 
"Currently Grovemade has 19 employees and they continue to assess, tweak, and improve every aspect of their company from their product offerings to their production process. 'We don’t really have a direct competitor, no one out there is doing wood products like us, the tolerances and fit that we maintain doesn’t exist anywhere else in our market,' says Ken. And they are not interested in changing that by devaluing their process to increase their profit margin.[...]We know they will continue to grow and we hope that they will add many more annual rings to their business.

Happy 4th of July! We&#39;re Proud to be Makers in the USA!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We’re proud of making almost all of our products right here in Oregon. Made-in-the-USA is a tag we love to attach to the products we create here. Our business philosophy is pretty simple: we like crafting the best quality goods out of the best quality of materials, so that’s what we do! (Even if it may be the hard way.)
 
All hands on deck at our weekly team meeting!
 
Cheaper material and labor costs drive businesses overseas constantly, and it makes sense. It’s expensive to run a company that manufactures in the US. Don’t get us wrong, there are plenty of wonderful goods being made all around the world. But, our hats are off to the other companies here in the United States that make it work and create American-made products and jobs on our side of the grass.
Here are some Made-in-the-USA websites that feature Grovemade alongside other companies making stuff at home:
Brand New USA - http://www.brandnewusa.com/
USA Love List - http://www.usalovelist.com/gifts-for-him/
Made in USA Trader - http://classifieds.madeinusatrader.com/hsx/
 
To celebrate the upcoming 4th of July weekend, we simply wanted to share some photos and videos we’ve compiled of our talented team working here in our Portland workshop.

We love this video showing the making of our SkateCase!
 
Here’s Ginger working the machines.
 
And, here’s our video showing the making of our new Wood Watch!
 
We hope everyone has a happy, fun, and safe Independence Day! Thank you for supporting us!

Sapphire and LiquidMetal Display Likely for iPhone 6
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
 
Signs continue to point to Apple pursuing a sapphire screen for the iPhone 6, along with a patented use of LiquidMetal, an exotic amorphous metal alloy, in a fused bezel protecting the phone’s predicted larger screen. (Above photo via http://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/apple-iphone-6-concept.png?w=704&amp;h=352.)
 
Regarding the iPhone screen size, as we discussed in last month’s roundup of iPhone 6 rumors:
 
“...the iPhone 6 will also allegedly be increasing screen resolution, possibly at 1704 x 906, a pixel-tripled resolution. This would mean a 4.7 inch model would have a pixel density of 416, the 5.5-inch version a pixel density of 365. It’s likely this high resolution screen will be a durable sapphire display. Rumors also paint a picture of a thinner iPhone for 2014, one that slims the 5’s 7.6mm thickness down to 6 to 7mm. To match the thinness of the iPhone itself, a thinner chassis and bezels are also predicted.”
 
https://idroid.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/iphone-6-ultra-thin-design-concept.jpg
 
According to Forbes, Apple is successfully pursuing ways to seamlessly embed the glass screen - or, more accurately, sapphire screen - within LiquidMetal bezels. Forbes’ contributor Anthony Wing Kosner writes, “[...]Apple has been ramping up sapphire production through its partner GT Advanced Technologies GTAT +2.3% and 9to5Mac reports that sapphire ingots from GTAT have started shipping to one of Apple’s Chinese manufacturing partners.” It’s also reported that Apple renewed its contract to utilize LiquidMetal for consumer products until 2016.
AppleInsider explains that, until now, LiquidMetal has been considered an exotic material, used for little else aside from a SIM card ejector tool. The material is classified as a bulk amorphous alloy. The “little else” consisted of some medical equipment, sporting goods, and military applications back in 2003.  
 
http://cdn.gottabemobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/iPhone-6-3.jpg
Apple's U.S. Patent No. 8,738,104 to use LiquidMetal is specifically for "Methods and systems for integrally trapping a glass insert in a metal bezel". AppleInsider writes:
“Instead of plastic, the material traditionally associated with injection molding, the patent uses metal in liquid form. Chief among alloy candidates is LiquidMetal, which behaves like a plastic and carries thermal properties advantageous to the MIM process. In some cases the thermal properties of select glass and metal materials can be matched to aid in production.”
 
http://www.todaysviral.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/iphone6-concept-pics-4.jpg
According to Digital Trends, the LiquidMetal will be used in Apple’s patented process to help stabilize the sapphire screen and protect it against drops. In its current phones, Apple uses plastic gaskets and a rubberized bezel to protect the iPhone’s screen from the inevitable tumble. Apple could go on using plastic, but the goal with LiquidMetal is likely a stronger bond between the screen and device, and therefore a more durable structure. This could be a key aspect in helping the company achieve a larger iPhone 6 size without destabilizing the screen.
Nothing is for sure until the Apple iPhone 6 is officially revealed, but that’s never stopped the rumor mill. Read more about Apple’s screen and LiquidMetal patent on, DigitalTrends, AppleInsider, and Forbes.

A Modern Wood Watch Designed by Us
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
 
We set out to make a wood watch that we’d like to use ourselves, one that adds a new element to time telling in the age of connectedness. We know that the exact time, along with a whole universe of facts, is right there in our pockets. But, we like the freedom a watch gives of living in the moment and keeping our phones out of it once and a while. The Wood Watch is contemporary in that it’s made with modern circular hands that revolve through 12 circular windows, forming eclipse-like shapes to peacefully communicate the hours and minutes as they pass.
 
 
We worked with designer Stefan Andrén to create this modern timepiece. Instead of taking a typical watch and replacing the metal and plastic components with wood, we designed the Wood Watch from the ground up, choosing each material for its unique strengths. We started with a Japanese movement for precision timekeeping. And, for the highest quality, our custom internal timekeeping module, which holds the movement, is built by an experienced overseas watch manufacturer. Next, a stainless steel casing is machined by our friends here in Portland, Oregon. 
 
 
Finally, at our own workshop, our team assembles and finishes each piece. We use our signature American, vegetable-tanned leather for the strap, available in three different shades. The leather strap is unisex and fits petite women to large men, and it softens with use and age, for a smooth feel. We also offer a silicone strap option in black, as a leather alternative. We mill, hand sand, and hand oil each hardwood watch face in gorgeous domestic maple or walnut. We put the wood element of the watch out front, instead of hiding it behind glass, as many other wooden watches do.
 
 
We’ve announced the Wood Watch months in advance of shipment, because we need your support and patience to make this project a reality. With early funding we’re able to afford the set-up costs this type of manufacturing requires. We’re excited to share our progress with the watch’s funders via monthly updates, as we start the manufacturing journey. We’re thrilled to bring this to fruition, and can’t wait to ship the watch to customers in late 2014 / early 2015.
 
 
Pre-order the watch here, or, if you’d prefer to wait, sign up to get a mailing list notification when the watch is available for immediate purchase.

Meet the New Grovemade Desk Collection
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
 
We know first-hand how great it is to feel amped to be at your desk, which is why we decided to make the Desk Collection with products that we’d want to use on our own desks. Your desk is a sanctuary speaking to your personality, creativity, and organizational skills. Upgrading your workspace can do wonders for your ergonomic comfort, productivity, and happiness, not to mention your bragging rights with co-workers. 
 
 
We think these beautiful and beneficial items, like the Monitor Stand, add order, beauty, and inspiration to the work area. Most monitors are too short, causing slouching. We decided to make premium wooden stands to replace the stacks of books under our own monitors. The Monitor Stand raises your monitor four inches from your desk, helping you straighten out your back and neck while you work, whether you’re at a sitting or standing desk. And, with the space you gain underneath your raised monitor, the stand helps you save space as well as your posture.
 
 
Along with the Monitor Stand, you can mix and match these handcrafted products to create your ideal workspace. The Keyboard Tray with storage space works well with the Wrist Pad and Mouse Pad, both with supple premium leather for comfort. The Pen Cup and Paperclip Holder keep your workspace neat, and our matching Succulent Planters add greenery to your environment. Complete the collection with a Desk Lamp with your choice of attention-grabbing bulb.
 
 
The continuity of the design and the high quality materials help your desk remain cohesive, even when your mind is going in all directions. Everyday, you can surround yourself with the warmth and distinction of natural hand-sanded wood and vegetable-tanned leather: in happy, bright maple or dark, rich black walnut, your choice.
 
 
We believe that when you work hard, you deserve a little workplace beautification.

Father&#39;s Day Gift Guide: Made in Portland
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
It’s Father’s Day! We love getting our dads unique, made-in-Portland gifts, so we decided to put together a list of some winning present ideas that accurately represent the great Pacific Northwest. We did sprinkle in a few Grovemade products, but can you blame us? Our dads love the stuff we make, so it’s only fair that we include it.
Piranha 2, by Leatherman, $25.00
http://www.leatherman.com/831680.html
Dad will treasure this special little tool -- a single-piece, multi-purpose pocket savior fit for McGuyver himself. The Piranha 2 is 100% stainless steel, with a built-in rubber bit holder that holds a Leatherman bit. With this go-go-gadget, Dad can tighten screws, loosen bolts, pry things open, open beverages, and more. He can take it with him everywhere, everyday. It’s even TSA-compliant, so it’s plane safe!
Walnut iPhone Case, by Grovemade (that’s us!), $99.00
http://grovemade.com/product/walnut-iphone-case/?initial=15
Dad deserves the classiest iPhone case of them all, and we’ve got it right here. Our wood iPhone 5/5S case in walnut is the king of the jungle, when it comes to iPhone accessories. It’s handcrafted, timeless, elegant, and handsome, just like your father (yes, he’s handcrafted, too). The all-natural Black Walnut wood we use is dark, rich, sturdy, and respectable. You know Dad loves putting cases on things, so give him the best.
Travel Cribbage Board, by Walnut Studio, $45.00
http://walnutstudiolo.com/collections/home/products/travel-cribbage-board
If your dad knows what cribbage is, this is the ultimate gift. Walnut Studio designed this travel board to emulate the pocket games soldiers in WWII used to carry. It’s maybe the smallest cribbage board available, which is cool. Your pops can pop this out at any social function to score instant cool points. “Hey wanna play some cribbs?” he’ll ask. “We don’t have a board!” his bud will say. “Yah! I got one right here in my pocket!” your Dad’ll say! This cribbage board has an antique brass snap closure, laser engraved board with 60-point loop, a removable brass tube to hold its solid copper pegs, and a premium cork plug.
Maggie photo frame, by Plywerk, $49 and up
http://www.plywerk.com/order/product/maggie
Dads are rarely described as the most sentimental bunch, but that’s even more reason why you should do him a favor and showcase one of his favorite photos for him. This frame is a work of art in itself, and it holds the photo in place using extremely strong magnets! Everyone loves magnets! Plywerk crafts their pieces from high-quality, eco-friendly bamboo. This frame comes with a beautiful bamboo stand, which can be fit into two different keyholes in the back, for dual orientation.
Walnut iPad Sleeve, by Grovemade, $89
http://grovemade.com/product/walnut-ipad-sleeve/?initial=59
Our Walnut iPad Sleeve makes a great gift for dads that are up on their tablet game. Made from all-natural Black Walnut veneer with wool lining, this sleeve has a convenient leather and brass pull strap that makes it easy to pull out the iPad when it’s time to use the NPR app or check the weather. This sleeve is a sure-fire conversation piece, and Dad will never tire of bragging about his awesome son/daughter who’s great at gift-giving.
Portland Area Brewery Tour, by YOU
http://oregoncraftbeer.org/breweries/portland-area/
Deschutes Brewery in NW Portland
Did you know that there are over 100 Oregon craft beer brewery locations in the Portland area alone? A great gift for Father’s Day would be a custom beer tour around Portland, curated by yours truly. Find a handful of brewery locations in convenient spots, commit to being the old man’s DD, and get ready for a fun afternoon! This list by Oregon Craft Beer can help get you started with planning your beer-tasting escapade.
The GriGri Satin Grey Growler, Portland Growler Co, $65.00
http://portlandgrowlercompany.com/products/the-grigri-satin-grey
If you want to upgrade Dad’s portland brewery tour, you can order one of these 64-ounce babies, and present it before you head out to try your first beer. He can take his favorite craft brew home with him. Portland Growler Company makes growlers that are slip cast by hand with the tightest lid fit possible. This growler is cast thick, and the wide mouth ceramic flip top lid with rubber gasket will keep his beverage cold and crisp for days.
Limited Edition Dock in Brass + Walnut, by Grovemade, $149
http://grovemade.com/product/limited-edition-dock-brass-walnut/?initial=51
The iPhone Dock is a major life upgrade for work or home, and dads are no exception to this fact. A perfect match, and the classiest of our iPhone Dock models, this Black Walnut wood and solid brass limited edition dock goes wonderfully with the iPhone case in Walnut. Dad will never lose his charging cord, and it weighs a heavy 3 lbs, so he can plug and unplug his phone easily using just one hand.
We won’t go so far as to say, “you can’t go wrong with this gift guide,” but, we suspect that there’s something in here that your dad will like a whole lot. From beer to tech products, Portland is home to the making of some pretty neat products.

New iPhone Case Collaboration with Blaine Fontana and Forest For The Trees
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We’re happy to announce a new limited edition case on our site! This iPhone 5/5S case is a collaboration with artist Blaine Fontana and Portland non-profit mural project Forest for the Trees. A limited edition of only 25 pieces, each case combines colorful direct printing, laser engraving, and spray painting done by hand on domestic Eastern hardrock maple.
 
Our hand-sanded Maple Case becomes a colorful, engraved piece of art with a one-of-a-kind, personalized white splash spray painted by the artist himself. For each Blaine Fontana case for sale on our site, another was donated to Forest for the Trees to support their 2014 mural projects.
 
ABOUT BLAINE FONTANA
Blaine Fontana is an artist living and working in Portland, Oregon. In the words of his studio site, he “fuses multiple visual strategies to forge an aesthetic language entirely of his own making” and straddles “the physical and metaphysical, organic and architectural, painterly and graphic sensibilities.” Read more about him and see his work here.

iPhone 6 Rumors and News
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
With the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) approaching on June 2nd, news and speculation about the new iPhone 6 release abound. Some sources even predict the new model of iPhone will be introduced at the WWDC, instead of the typical fall release date for 2014. This phone, allegedly too awesome to keep under wraps for much longer, is rumored to have a larger display, higher pixel resolution, and a thinner shape.
http://www.ciccaresedesign.com/2014/02/07/iphone-6-larger-screen/
Here’s a rundown of the most popular iPhone 6 rumors:
Screen size is increasing from 4 inches to a suggested 4.7 to 5.5 inches
There will be two different phones released, one at 4.7 and one at 5.5 inches
The iPhone 6 may not be called “iPhone 6” at all; iPhone Air and iPhone Mini are options for a two-size release
Resolution is increasing to a rumored 1704 x 906 pixels
iPhone 6 will have a durable Sapphire display
The phone’s thickness will decrease from 7.6 mm to 6 to 7mm
The bezels and chassis will be thinner
The iPhone 6 will be introduced in June at the WWDC
 
One of the most important changes being speculated is the increase of the iPhone 6’s screen from 4 inches on the iPhone 5/5S to a rumored 4.7 to 5.5 inches. This would place the Apple iPhone among the Android and Windows smartphones that have sparked the larger display trend. Thanks to MacRumors, we already know that Apple knows consumers want larger and cheaper phones. The smartphone giant already addressed cost with the introduction of the iPhone 5C, and perhaps they’ll be making moves on the larger phone market this year with the next iPhone generation.
http://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-6/
To go along with a larger display, the iPhone 6 will also allegedly be increasing screen resolution, possibly at 1704 x 906, a pixel-tripled resolution. This would mean a 4.7 inch model would have a pixel density of 416, the 5.5-inch version a pixel density of 365. It’s likely this high resolution screen will be a durable sapphire display. Rumors also paint a picture of a thinner iPhone for 2014, one that slims the 5’s 7.6mm thickness down to 6 to 7mm. To match the thinness of the iPhone itself, a thinner chassis and bezels are also predicted.
Furthermore, if Apple does release two versions, one at 4.7 inches and one at 5.5 inches, the iPhone’s naming convention may go out the window. iPhone Air and iPhone Mini are options, with naming modeled after the iPad Air and iPad Mini. Yet, there are complications to the company’s rumored larger new iPhone model, which conjures the term “phablet”. Tech Radar reported that Apple was having trouble figuring out how to get a battery powerful enough to run the larger screen inside such a thin phone shape. We’ll see how it all panned out once the phone, or phones, are released.
http://www.ciccaresedesign.com/2014/02/07/iphone-6-larger-screen/
Typically, Apple waits until after summer to reveal its latest iPhone design. However, several industry insiders are chattering about a potential WWDC iPhone 6 introduction, which would reveal the phone the week of June 2nd. Digital Trends reported on Eldar Murtazin’s recent tweet which stated that Apple is eyeing a June release in order to better compete against new Android phones from Samsung and HTC. Jeffries analyst Peter Misek agrees that a June release is entirely possible.
http://www.ciccaresedesign.com/2014/02/07/iphone-6-larger-screen/
The above rumors circulating about the iPhone 6 are among other speculations, including curved screens, a better camera, iOS8, and even solar charging. Some of these updates are very likely, while others may truly be rumors, gossip, tidbits stretched from unreliable sources. The rumor mill will keep chugging along, as always, until we can finally glimpse the new iPhone 6.
You can bet we’ll be hard at work here at Grovemade, once we get the specs on Apple’s new creation, along with the rest of the world. It’ll be time to design our exciting new wood iPhone 6 case. iPhone 6 or bust!

Grovemade Gets Inspired In Japan
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Last month, our co-founders, Joe and Ken, and our programmer, Yuji, traveled to Japan with a small group of Portland crafters to take part in POP UP PDX. The event included two pop-up shops of small Portland companies, one in Tokyo and one in Kyoto, which showcased the work of Grovemade and other similar companies, like our friends and neighbors at QuarterTwenty and Woodblock Chocolate.
Portland, as a brand, is really trending these days in Japan, and the goal of POP UP PDX was to expose nine Portland companies to the Japanese market. The best part of the trip was cementing friendships with our fellow Portland craftspeople as well as creating new friendships with the incredibly talented Japanese craftspeople Ken, Joe, and Yuji met, which were all 2nd to 5th generation in their trades. Read about some of the Japanese craftspeople they met below:
 
 
Yuki Yokoyama, from Kyoto, a master bamboo craftsman
 
Yokoyama San’s company [http://www.yokotake.co.jp/] resides in an old residential area of Kyoto, supplying various bamboo materials and also doing custom bamboo craftwork. His warehouse is packed with hundreds of different species of bamboo, from $10,000/stick rarities to squiggly bamboo and bamboo grown into a square shape. Ken, Joe, and Yuji were amazed at the large selection at this bamboo wonderland!

Kenji Takenaka operates a print shop [http://takezasado.com/] in Kyoto in the second story of an old house. The print shop ceiling is only 5 feet tall, so the apprentices have to squat down while they work. It’s quite a tightly packed space, like many of the Japanese workshops visited. The low ceiling was made from ropes loaded with prints hung to dry. Kenji’s print shop does original contemporary work as well as reprints of traditional Japanese works. They also refurbish ancient printing blocks.

Tomita-san, from Kyoto, 2nd generation master wood carver
 
Tomita-san’s wood carving studio creates and repairs intricate wood sculptures, mostly for Buddhist temples and memorials. He was a typical Japanese businessman for a while, before returning home to continue the family’s traditional business of carving. His father carved the memorial statues for the previous Japanese Emperor, Emperor Shōwa. And, Tomita-san himself carved the statues for the current Emperor’s memorial, Emperor "Kinjō"s. Tomita-san showed us some of his incredible techniques, including gold leafing by hand (which leads to prices upwards of $50,000 for a sculpture like the one pictured here). Our Grovemade "ambassadors" were very impressed by this traditional craft!

Wataru Hara, from Nagano, master furniture designer and architect
 
Master furniture designer Wataru Hara [http://studiohara.sakura.ne.jp/index.html] was trained in architecture, but also designs and makes unique furniture pieces -- often for use inside the homes he designs. He’s designed several restaurants and cafes, which were visited on the trip. Ken, Joe, and Yuji were also able to stay at his beautiful guest home in the mountains, which was loaded with gorgeous custom furniture.
A view from Hara San's studio
 
Typically, Hara San will design the home, have it built by a team of builders, and then commence creating the perfect custom furniture pieces to be used inside the home. Ken, Joe, and Yuji were most impressed by his incredible patience. Hara San will only use a slab of wood after it’s had ten years to dry in his workshop.

Mitsu Nakajima, from Kyoto, 2nd generation photographer
 
Another new friend from Japan is Mitsu Nakajima, who specializes in traditional photography, such as photos of temples and old architecture. Nakajima San also does contemporary and commercial photography. He shoots on medium and large format film, and recently had a book [http://www.sandome-kyoto.jp/] published of photos of temples and other important places in Kyoto.

All in all, it was an amazing trip for Ken, Joe, and Yuji. They solidified lasting friendships with local craftspeople and formed new ones with the amazing Japanese craftspeople mentioned here, and others! Check out one last picture of Ken, Joe, and Yuji standing with a deer in Nara, a city known for the friendly and sacred deer that wander freely through the town.

Mother&#39;s Day Gift Guide 2014
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Chances are, you think your mom is the best, or you love a mom who is the best to her little ones. Even if you think she is maybe only second or third best, you probably feel she deserves the best, because you are so full of appreciation. We’ve compiled a short Mother’s Day gift guide of Grovemade products we know mothers love, along with some other high quality, handcrafted items made right here in Portland, Oregon.
Scribble Hanging Planter, Pigeon Toe ceramics
Everyone knows moms love to hang things from the ceiling, especially plants. She’ll hang her plants in style with this hand-thrown porcelain hanging planter, a modern update on the macrame planters you grew up with. Give her a plant already potted in this elegant vessel, and it’s a gift better than flowers, because it will keep on growing! Pigeon Toe has gift certificates, great for time-sensitive occasions.
Maple iPad Sleeve, Grovemade
Moms and their iPads, right? She’ll love protecting hers in our contoured, flexible wood and wool sleeve that keeps the iPad safe from impacts and scratches. It’s shown here in maple but is also available in rich walnut or in larger versions for MacBook Air. The sleeve has a warm, organic feel and is surprisingly soft to the touch for a wood veneer product. It’s got a leather and solid brass pull tab to help mom get her iPad out of the sleeve without grabbing or tugging.
Sullivan Table Lamp in White + Walnut, Caravan Pacific
Light up Mom’s life with this classy table lamp made by hand in Portland. The clean white and wood design brightens any room and goes with virtually all decor. This lamp has a white matte stoneware base, walnut wood neck and finial, a white linen shade, and a side rocker switch.
Maple iPhone Dock, Grovemade
Our iPhone Dock makes a wonderful gift for anyone. But, we’ve heard its praises directly from the mouths of moms. This wood and solid steel iPhone Dock gives your mom a dependable spot to charge her phone, while also classing up her nightstand, desktop, or wherever she places it. And, in case you haven’t heard, it weighs a heavy 3 lbs, so she can plug and unplug her phone easily using just one hand.
Matchsticks Tote Bag, Nell &amp; Mary
Make Mom’s shopping and errands 400% more pleasant (scientifically proven) with this spacious canvas carryall. It’s made from organic cotton canvas and hand printed with this playful Matchsticks design in charcoal gray. The straps are vegetable tanned leather with antique brass rivets. Three interior canvas pockets help Mom keep things organized.  
You can’t go wrong with any of these mother-loving gifts. Of course, we stand by our Grovemade products as wonderful surprises for your loved ones. And, we adore any products made here in our Pacific Northwest paradise, especially products that are made to stand out and last long. So, let’s hear it for the moms! Let’s give those moms a hand!

Meet the Wood Sleeve for MacBook Air and iPad
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
If you’re like us, you want an iPad cover or MacBook sleeve that’s a step up from the typical leather or neoprene pouch design. Our new Wood Sleeve for iPad Air, iPad Mini, and MacBook Air 13 inch is a treat to look at, with its modern organic shape and high quality natural materials.
The new Sleeve offers smart, natural protection for your iPad or Macbook. It’s a definite upgrade for your daily tech toting. Thick premium German wool is the perfect cushion to protect your hardware from bumps and scratches on the go, and hardwood veneer with geometric contouring catches the eye, creating an instant conversation piece, while providing impact resistance.
 
A leather and brass pull strap lets you remove your device without grabbing or tugging; domestic vegetable tanned leather is wrapped around a solid brass rod, providing an excellent grip. You’ll want to hang onto this made-in-Oregon sleeve, with its hand sanded and hand oiled wood, available in Eastern hardrock maple or Eastern black walnut. To ensure you can hang onto it for years to come, the wool is sewn with durability in mind.
 
The Wood Sleeve is compatible with iPad Air, iPad Mini, iPad Mini with Retina Display, and 13" MacBook Air. It starts at the introductory price of $79 for iPad Mini, $89 for iPad Air, and $99 for 13” MacBook Air.
