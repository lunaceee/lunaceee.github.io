iPhone 5 or 4s?
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Tomorrow is the big announcement on the new iPhone(s). &nbsp;We at Grove have been following the rumors for months. &nbsp;Blogs such as TUAW and MacRumors are great for keeping up on the latest. &nbsp;Unlike the iPhone4 which had the infamous Gizmodo leak (Apple engineer leaves a prototype at a bar), Apple has been able to keep their latest plans relatively leak-free, thus shrouding the latest iPhone release in mystery. &nbsp;
Much of the confusion results from new case designs which have been popping up in China showing a slightly tapered tear drop design. &nbsp;Some case makers feel confident enough about that direction that they have been manufacturing these cases for weeks, believing it to be the "iPhone 5". &nbsp;However, there have been no reliable reports of any of these being made in the supply chain fueling theories that the next iPhone will be an "iPhone 4s" which is identical to the iPhone 4 on the outside but upgraded inside, similar to the iPhone 3/iPhone 3GS. &nbsp;
Most media publications are going back and forth on whether it will be a completely new "iPhone 5" released or just an upgraded iPhone 4. &nbsp;We at Grove are ready for either scenario to develop a new case as soon as possible. &nbsp;By doing all the design/prototyping/production ourselves right here in our workshop in Portland, Oregon, we can be quicker and much more nimble than the big corporations to develop new products. &nbsp;No need to fly to China. ;) &nbsp;

&#34;Radiant Totem&#34; by Damion Silver
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
&nbsp;
We're pleased to introduce a new design from long-time collaborator Damion Silver (iPhone, iPad). We got a chance to ask Damion for a bit of insight into his process...
Please give us a brief bio and description of your background as an artist.
I grew up in Connecticut and got into skateboarding when I was around 11. I always drew as a kid, was always into art and music.&nbsp;I took Intro To Design in IA Class in high school and that kind of set my path, screen printing shirts and selling them at contests and such.&nbsp;I started showing work in the early 90's in cafes and galleries, lots of photo work initially followed by more paintings.
What medium do you prefer to work in?
My latest work is collage and assemblage based, lots of found objects, paper goods and such. I mix my character totem-esq drawings in along with other words and doodles. I have been bringing back these faces I have been drawing forever. They are like little meditations on&nbsp;people and places. The work is always changing and evolving.&nbsp;I really enjoy working with a mixed bag of things. Old paper, spray paint, ball point pens, photo copy transfers, acrylics,&nbsp;then using some technology too. Laser etching and digital prints.
What's in your artists toolkit
A band saw, table saw, compound miter saw, wood glue, all kinds of paint, lots of found wood and signs, silk screens, boxes of paper, wood carving knives.&nbsp;My favorite new tool is a blow torch. Experimenting with that now. It's fun.
What's your work space like?
My space is now in the basement of my house. My wife says its a "man cave" but I like "studio."
Two large tables, full wood shop, screen printing turntable, piles of wood and records, empty beer bottles and lots of pieces in the works.
Can you walk us through your typical work day?
During the week I do the nine to five as a Design Director so that's alot of meetings, drawings and problem solving. After nine I get in the studio and work&nbsp;for a few hours. On the weekend it's me kicking it with my kid, hitting up flea markets in the good weather and when he naps I get in the studio and work.&nbsp;I guess I'm constantly trying to create things with my kid, at work or in the studio.
Who are some of your influences?
Artistically, Rauschenberg has always amazed me. Early 90's (Adam) Cost and Revs in NYC, and Dondi White. His work is just timeless.
Personally it would be my grandfather. He was the most influential person in my life. He was not an artist or anything.&nbsp;Just a solid guy. I still try to rise up and be like him. Miss ya Gramps!
Does music influence your work? If so, what are some of your favorites?
Oh for sure. It feeds the creative process. I have been blindly buying records as of late. Some new good stuff I've been listening to has been Mahavishnu Orchestra, Buddy Miles and Santana, Richard Pryor, Shuggie Otis. Hendrix will always be at the top. It all depends on the mood. Some Classic BDP, Primus, Iron Maiden. Lots of new metal like Priestess, Witch, Electric Wizard. I'm all&nbsp;over the place musically.
What would your dream project be?
A big public installation using objects and iconography from the surrounding area for a park or maybe a museum courtyard. That would be&nbsp;a great project, leaving something behind that outlasts me.
Finally, what advice would you give to a young artist?
Stay the course, have fun, experiment. Don't let people tell you what your work needs to be like, just do what feels good. If you are looking to&nbsp;show work in galleries find spaces where you respect the artists they show and reach out to them.

Introducing &#34;Submarine&#34; by Ryan Chapman
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
The hits just keep on coming! We're pleased to introduce "Submarine", a new design from England-based illustrator Ryan Chapman.&nbsp;Chapman works in a variety of mediums including paint, vector, and plasticine figures. Ryan was able to give us a bit of insight into his work and process.
Please give us a brief bio and description of your background as an artist.
Ryan Chapman : I've always drawn as far as i can remember. I don't come from an art family but I do remember my mother painting our walls in chalkboard paint so me and my brother could draw on the walls. When I left school I applied to study graphic design at college but I was told I had to get the right grades from school to be accepted. When I got my results they were not good enough, so I decided to just go along on the first day of college anyway as I had nothing to lose. They did a call sheet and at the end asked if anyone had not been called out. A few other people put up their hands, me included. Four years later I finished with a dagree in illustration.
What other jobs have you done outside of the fine art world?
RC : After graduating I worked in advertising in London, then spent a good few years living and traveling all over the world, doing a range of design and non-design related jobs including surf instructor, furniture removal man, graphic designer and product designer.
What tools are in your toolkit?
RC: I use a lot of solid bold colours when i paint so i really enjoy cell vinyl paint. Its thick and drys quickly, but the results are the best.
What's your work space like?&nbsp;
RC: I used to share a beautiful old top floor warehouse space in Estonia. It was a great space I shared with a group of designers, film makers and musicans. The summers were amazing, but the winters in Estonia would reach - 20°, so it got a little chilly. I'm now living back in London and working from a small but cozy studio/home pod.
Can you walk us through your typical project process?
RC: I&nbsp;start with my sketch book which I carry everywhere. I usually look through it for ideas and sketches, things that i scribbled roughly and forgot about. Then from there it's onto the computer or paint.
What are some of your influences?&nbsp;
RC: Forests, the ocean, waves, shapes, traveling, airports, surfing, boats, instruments, people living simply in order to stay creative.
Do you create to music? If so, what's currently on your playlist?
RC: Currently on my playlist is Wild Nothing, Serge Gainsbourg, Slayer, M83, Nick Drake.
What's on the horizon?&nbsp;
RC: I have just been taken on by YCN London agency for my illustration commissions.&nbsp;I'm currently in the process of creating a modern and simplistic version of the 'Ship in a Bottle.' It's a tricky process, but the end result should be eye-catching and something I hope to release in a limited edition. I'm also working on a range of landscape posters based on surf locations I visited on my recent trips to Australia and California.
Do you have a dream project?
RC: I would love to write and illustrate a childrens book based on a small Turtle that loses his shell. That's all I have for now.&nbsp;
Finally, do you have any advice for upcoming artists?&nbsp;
RC: Draw. Try not to look too much at what others are doing (it just makes you sad) and introduce yourself and your work to as many companies and people as possible. You never know where it might lead.

&#34;Two Birds&#34; iPad 2 case now available!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Many of you have asked us when Mike Klay's popular design "two birds" will be available for our iPad 2 case, and the answer is now! His design has been a long time favorite on our bamboo iPhone 4 cases. The intricate branches look even better stretching across our leather iPad cover. Check out the short interview with Mike below and be sure to browse his other work at PowerSlideDesign.
Please give us a brief bio and description of your work.
I'm originally from San Jose, CA and currently reside in Seattle where it doesn't rain as often as people may think.&nbsp;I design and silk screen art prints and concert posters. My work consists of&nbsp;sleek patterns, rough textures and vector shapes without complicating things. &nbsp;I also take on other freelance projects to keep things fresh.
What inspires you?&nbsp;
The great outdoors. &nbsp;Nothing gets the brain flowing more than open spaces with views.
What medium do you prefer to work in?&nbsp;
I'm a vector man, Illustrator is my friend. &nbsp;
What's in your artists toolkit?
A sketchbook, pencils, pens, a macbook &amp; iMac, some emulsion, screens, ink &amp; squeegees.
What's your work space like?
I print in my garage, pack tubes with prints in my basement, and draw everywhere else.
Can you walk us through your typical work day?
Not really. &nbsp;Every day is different. &nbsp;I do have a day job though, so that's pretty much the same Monday-Friday.
Who are some of your influences?
My fellow poster artists on gigposters.com. &nbsp;Some of the most talented individuals creating art on the planet right now.
Does music influence your work? If so, what are some of your favorites?
As a seasoned concert poster artist, I usually ask myself just one question before starting on a design for a certain band. What does the music look like? If I follow this recipe, I usually end up creating something that works really well.&nbsp;
Bloc Party w/Menomena (19" x 25" 3-Color Screenprint)
What piece/project are you most proud of and why?
It always ends up being my most current project or print. &nbsp;I guess that's what keeps me going in a forward direction.
What would your dream project be?
Finishing my Music City series of prints. &nbsp;4 out 12 completed. &nbsp;After that, I can start thinking about something new.
"Electric Beat" from the Music City series (24" x 18" 2-Color Screenprint)
What's on the horizon?
Printing just got a little easier now that I bought a semi-automatic press. &nbsp;Less trips to the massage therapist!
If you could have one super power, what would it be?
The ability to clone myself to do 2 things at once.
Finally, what advice would you give to a young artist?
Only create art if you're passionate about it. &nbsp;Don't listen to anyone else, the only opinion that matters is your own.

Hand-rubbed Natural Finishes
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Apple products are so clean and shiny with perfect looking materials such as anodized aluminum and glass. &nbsp;Pretty much when you take em out of the box for the first time they get damaged or scratched and we groan “arrrgggghh”. &nbsp;They instantly degrade and slowly get worse and worse over time. &nbsp;We buy cases for these products because we don’t want that to happen. &nbsp;The Grove way of thinking is the total opposite where our products are made of natural imperfect materials and they are supposed to wear gracefully with time and get better, not worse!
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Typically, mass produced wood products are sprayed with a laquer or polyurethane clear coat which gives the wood a plastic layer of protection. &nbsp;While being the most efficient and protective way of finishing wood, quite often it results in a plasticky look which I object to. &nbsp;Covering up the wood with plastic to give it properties that are not wood like is strange to me. &nbsp;Why use wood in the first place if you want it to be plastic? &nbsp;From my many years of building custom furniture www.tomitadesigns.com I have always preferred hand rubbed natural oil finishes. &nbsp;Oil finishes penetrate and go into the wood, rather than on top. &nbsp;They bring out the beauty of the grain and still allow you to feel the material for what it is because it is inside, not outside the material. &nbsp;It allows the material to be what it is and be true to itself. &nbsp;In the long run an oil finish will hold up better than a plastic clearcoat. &nbsp;Clearcoats scratch easier and can yellow or peel in time and are near impossible to repair yourself. &nbsp;Oil finishes get better with age and can be reapplied if necessary by amateurs. &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At Grove we use a 4 step proprietary process for finishing our bamboo products. &nbsp;Some of the ingredients in our process are tung oil, special aged linseed oil, beezwax, pure citrus solvent, pine rosin, sunflower oil, soybean oil, thistle oil, carnauba wax, and candelilla wax. &nbsp;The oil has to be rubbed in by hand and then buffed out. &nbsp;&nbsp;The result of all this&nbsp;tedious&nbsp;hand work is a finish that will patina gracefully with time. &nbsp;As you touch it your hand oils will darken the finish similar to how leather darkens with use. &nbsp;Many people love the smell too, primarily from the pure citrus solvent which smells like orange peels! &nbsp;If you are lucky you will get a case hand finished by my mom. She does about half of them herself! &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The laborious process of hand rubbed oil finishing requires a full day waiting between coats which slows down our production time and increases our costs significantly. &nbsp;However, the aesthetic beauty is superior and the concept behind an oil finish are well worth the extra effort. &nbsp;We hope that with Grove products you will think differently than with the original Apple product and appreciate the unique patina created by the passage of time. &nbsp;Instead of being disappointed with the constant degradation and separation from perfection lets be at peace with natural aging. &nbsp;

Birdland Now Available for iPad2!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Sven Palmowski has been part of Grove since the very beginning with his iconic design "birdland". Originally available on our bamboo iPhone cases, you can now decorate your iPad 2 with his design laser engraved into our magnetic leather cover. I've been following Sven's work for several years now after discovering his incredible t-shirt designs. He is one of the most prolific illustrators I know, make sure to checkout his full portfolio!&nbsp;Sven was kind enough to answer a quick interview, learn what inspires this ink master below.
Please give us a brief bio and description of your work?
I´m a German-born, Spain-based illustrator, I studied fine arts back in the nineties and I´m freelancing ever since. I would describe my work as linwework-based and a little bit Pop Surrealism-driven:)
What inspires you?&nbsp;
Objects, old stuff, music, movies, even street art...
What medium do you prefer to work in?&nbsp;
Pen, ink and Photoshop.
What's in your artists toolkit?
Pen, ink, Photoshop and coffee.
What's your work space like?
Pretty clean, bright and spacey, I´m not the messy kind of artist, actually I´m more the "bureaucratic" kind of artist.
Can you walk us through your typical work day?
Coffee, Pen, Ink, Photoshop, TV, bed.
Who are some of your influences?
Some German artists from the 1920s, George Grosz, Otto Dix, etc..., Dada, Francis Bacon maybe... some of the contemporary "Pop Surrealsm" illustrators...
Does music influence your work? If so, what are some of your favorites?
It does ...The Radio Dept, Andrew Bird, Crystal Castles, Dawes, Joy Division, Lykke Li, Modest Mouse, New Order, Sufjan Stevens, The Smiths, The Stranglers, etc, etc...
What piece/project are you most proud of and why?
While we are here at grove, "Birdland" is def. one of them.
What would your dream project be?
I´d like to do more Gig posters for bands I love...
What's on the horizon?
Summer! Sitting on a beach, on the horizon there are only a few boats and seagulls...
If you could have one super power, what would it be?
That is one popular question, haha:)&nbsp;
...Being the "Questionator" of course...
Finally, what advice would you give to a young artist?
Does that mean I´m no longer being considered a young artist myself?
Haha, kidding, of course I´m not...&nbsp;
Patience is important, I had to wait until I was 30 before I started to get real illustration jobs... so take it easy:)

iPad 2 case fit
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Were really stoked about our fit system for our iPad 2 case. &nbsp;Joe and I have been tinkering with iPad concepts for a year and kept an eye on what is out there and what people are looking for. &nbsp;We found that there were many complaints about iPads falling out of some cases, mostly due to designs which rely on rubber corner pads. &nbsp;I'm not sure but I'm suspecting the rubber compressed over time and no longer had the friction that it once had. &nbsp;
We wanted to come up with a system that was A) foolproof: iPad would never ever fall out accidentally and B) easy to get in and out and C) looks good (ya know- thats how we roll). Now, its not as easy as you think to fulfill both criteria since they&nbsp;tend to counteract each other.&nbsp;Also, I don't like designs where you can see some kind of mechanism that holds your iPad in place- I'm more for "magical" (to borrow the word from Apple) systems where you cant really see how its done but its just done. &nbsp;
After much trial and error we came up with an elegant solution which we call our "pressure fit design". &nbsp;Basically it relies on compression but when the iPad is in the case its locked underneath a lip, meaning that it cannot fall out even if you "etch a sketch" it. &nbsp;Hard to explain, best to watch the video! &nbsp;By the way we do all the video work ourselves. &nbsp;Joe made the video and I'm the hand model. DIY baby! &nbsp;-Ken

iPad 2 Case Official Launch!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We're happy to announce that our iPad 2 case is online and ready for purchase. Yay! Joe and I had been tinkering with iPad case ideas since the first iPad came out and made several prototypes which we never brought to market. &nbsp;We used bamboo of course and even made an all leather version. &nbsp;Those failed prototypes are a&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;step to any healthy design process.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Our approach is to start with the product, think about how it is used and design from the ground up to make the best possible accessory out of natural materials. &nbsp;The more we refined our ideas the more we gravitated towards the mixing of soft and hard materials for their specific advantages. &nbsp;
&nbsp;
When the iPad 2 came out we were shocked with the introduction of the integrated Apple Smart Cover. &nbsp;Apple obviously is really pushing the cover and the functionality offered not only by the multiple positions it can hold but the automatic on/off capability. &nbsp;We decided after much debate that we should re-design our case to take advantage of those features even at the cost of delaying our release. &nbsp;Form follows function here at Grove and we are very happy with the final design! &nbsp; BTW, check out these rad pictures taken by Joe. &nbsp;He is the man! &nbsp;-Ken

Introducing the Grove iPad 2 Case!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
&nbsp;
We're excited to announce two new iPad 2 accessories to join our handcrafted bamboo iPhone4 cases. Our iPad 2 case merges a bamboo back and a customizable leather smart cover and is now available for pre-order. The cover is made of American vegetable tanned leather and incorporates magnets which automatically wake the iPad 2 when it is opened and puts it to sleep when closed.&nbsp;
Panels of bamboo veneer give the leather cover structure and allow you to prop the iPad 2 up for typing or viewing. The cover has a soft Ultrasuede lining to help keep the iPad's screen clean and free of fingerprints.&nbsp;
For added style, we offer laser engraving on the case's leather cover. You can select from a constantly expanding artist series featuring fresh and original artwork from around the world, or get hands-on and upload your own custom art. We'll also be offering a lighter natural leather color which will have great contrast when engraved allowing you to upload even black and white photos.&nbsp;
Here at Grove, we're stoked about our new product and are sweating the smallest of details. We want to blow your mind with the quality and design of our new iPad 2 case.&nbsp;

<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Apple announced the iPad 2 today and it is SUWEEET! &nbsp;I was most surprised by how incredibly thin it is at .34" which is shockingly even thinner than the iPhone 4. &nbsp;Here at Grove we have been developing an iPad case for the past 6 months. &nbsp;We chose to wait for the iPad 2 to reveal our revolutionary design.&nbsp;
With a solid bamboo back and genuine leather front cover, the Grove iPad 2 case continues the Grove tradition of quality and innovation. Carefully crafted with quality materials here in Portland, Oregon by the Grove Team, our direct accountability to our customers ensures a better product that is ethically made.
The case mirrors the full function of the apple case by allowing a typing mode and viewing mode as well.
Both the vegetable tanned leather and hand rubbed oil finished bamboo will age gracefully like fine furniture. Once again, we have engineered as thin of a design as possible using natural materials to compliment the slender new iPad 2.
We will also be launching a series of bamboo skins for the iPad 2 [pictured above]. &nbsp;Available plain, custom, or artist series the skins work very well with the Apple Smart Covers if you so choose. Made from real bamboo veneer with a natural oil finish, protect and customize the back of your new iPad 2 with a Grove skin!

The newest bamboo art piece, "Grizzly Bird" by Option-G, stands tall at 18" height. I've been working with Cole for several years now and have collaborated with him on several other awesome projects. Cole's super unique illustration style provides a fresh perspective on this overdrawn subject matter. &nbsp;Checkout these great little bamboo birds which are available on Cole's site.
Cole's work is also featured on my other site, engrave your book, which sells leather Moleskine notebook covers. The piece below is called "blackbird" and has some interesting elements hiding in the branches.&nbsp;
Cole has a enormous portfolio of his work which you should check out at&nbsp;www.option-g.com&nbsp;Word on the street is that he's ditching LA and moving to Portland, OR this month. I'm excited to have Cole in town to bounce ideas off.&nbsp;

A while back we got a really nice thank you note from one of our loyal customers, Steve K who bought a 3G case and later an iPhone 4 case as well. &nbsp;He included 2 of these really nice laser engraved bamboo bookmarks as gifts for us that he sells at www.bamboodesignworks.com&nbsp;as a gift.&nbsp;&nbsp;We emailed a few times back and forth talking about bamboo, products, design, and owning small businesses. &nbsp;It was great to get detailed feedback from a fellow designer and customer. &nbsp;Thanks Steve! &nbsp;-Ken
I keep your current bamboo iPhone case on my desk at all times to serve as a daily reminder about designing products without compromise... plus it's really a fine example of industrial design as sculpture... for me it's as much inspirational as functional... yes, I'm a big fan!

We're stoked about our recent collaboration with skateboard jewelry maker, MapleXO! Lindsay has been turning broken decks and factory seconds into incredible jewelry since 2005. Creating a blank large enough for us to make an iPhone case from is tough and requires glueing up 10+ decks perfectly. The colorful dyed layers are completely random and every combination is unique. We'll be releasing a limited run of 50 cases soon. Priced at $200, they will each be super unique and individually numbered! &nbsp;Checkout some of Lindsay's rad jewelry below.

Great iPhone 4 case review on Gizmodo!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Joel Johnson of Gizmodo has written up a very thoughtful review on our product. &nbsp;
&nbsp;
Joel really "gets it". &nbsp;The review is candid, honest, and he sees our product the way I see it. &nbsp;Ultimately my goal as a designer is to get people to love how are products feel and love how our products make them feel. &nbsp;Here are a few excerpts from Joel's review:
With free iPhone cases abounding, an iffy economy, and a new truck project that's capable of taking every last dollar I can throw at it, why did I buy a $70&nbsp;iPhone case? Because it's the one I've always wanted.....
Here's the thing: It's wood. It's not&nbsp;supposed&nbsp;to be perfect. And as far as the quality of the workmanship goes, I am seriously impressed.
The design itself is smart, with a modern-looking trough to expose the volume controls and a 45° bezel around both edges that comes from the workshop with a smooth hand finish. (Much of the sanding and polishing on Grove cases is by hand, although they're not afraid of sanders either.)
It feels about as thin and precise as a wooden case could be. I can't ask for more.
Plus it's wood. Wood that feels better the more I hold my iPhone. Wood that has taken a couple of short falls and looked&nbsp;better&nbsp;as it has weather scuffs and scratches. Wood that's just pretty to look at, to turn idly in the hand.
There's no doubt it's a luxury. But it's a luxury I've been craving for years. Try as I might, I can't muster much regret—only spare pennies for when Grove releases an iPad version.&nbsp;
Thank you so much Joel for the thoughtful and thorough review! &nbsp;-Ken
