Introducing Max - Grove’s Art Director and Graphic Designer
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Grove’s
art director Max has been around since the beginning---helping to build
Grove from the ground up. He is responsible for the majority of the
aesthetics on our website and packaging, and remains hands-on as our
lead graphic designer and illustrator to boot. Recently, he put a lot of
work into the newly released SkateBacks. Even though Max's visual style can be seen throughout Grove's branding, he says that none of it would be possible without inspiration from the beautiful product design and the company's unique culture.
Max
hails from the coastal hamlet of Astoria, Oregon, where he went to high
school with Grove co-founder, Joe. He attended the University of Oregon
where he graduated with a BFA in Multimedia Design in 2006, and he was
even Joe’s first employee at his pre-Grove venture Engrave Your Book.
He’s
the type of artist who will work long hours at his day job and then go
home, roll up his sleeves and get to work on his own projects. Max makes
figurative artwork with a distinctive style that’s all about clean lines, vivid color combinations, and striking imagery that usually conveys a story. You can check out his artwork on his website: OrangeYear.com. &nbsp;Yeah!
He
summed it all up by saying that he considers himself lucky to have his
dream job. &nbsp;“I have a continual list of things I love to do, like
getting to correspond with cool artists around the world whose work I respect.”

content. &nbsp;You can see his work on his blog and his website.

Six Reasons to Fall in Love With Your iPhone All Over Again This Fall
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
It’s
time to get excited about your current iPhone or iPad all over again!
Apple recently announced the upcoming autumn release of iOS 6, which
will be compatible with iPhone
3GS and later, 2nd-generation iPad and later, and the 4th-generation
iPod touch. Among other new features, the updated operating system will
offer enhancements to Siri and Facebook along with a new Maps
application and shared photo streams through iCloud.
At
Monday’s WWDC keynote event, Apple’s senior vice president of iOS
Software Scott Forstall stated, “iOS 6 continues the rapid pace of
innovation that is helping Apple reinvent the phone and create the iPad
category, delivering the best mobile experience available on any
device.”
Here’s an overview of some of the most exciting updates:
For Siri-enabled devices, Siri will gain knowledge in some foreign languages, sports &nbsp;even launching apps.
Facebook will become more integrated with system-wide login capabilities and the ability to post from other apps.
New
do-not-disturb options will be available for hushing app notifications
and responding to ignored calls with pre-set text messages and call-back
reminders
Shared
Photo Streams will allow users to share pics with select friends and
family through other iOS devices, iPhoto or Aperture, and Apple TV.
Passbook,
a new wallet app, will store payment cards and electronic tickets -
such as Starbucks’ Gold Card, Fandango movie tickets, plane and sports
tickets, and more.
A
new Maps app will be outfitted with Apple’s own map data, Yelp business
information, traffic data sourced in real-time from users, and
turn-by-turn navigation triggered by Siri.
Cult
of Mac calls these “some of the biggest UI improvements Apple has made
in the history of iOS.” Our own iOS users on the Grove team can’t wait
to get a fun revamp on their devices come fall. Luckily, if you’re a
developer, you don’t need to wait to begin coding for the new system! On
Monday, Apple released the software development kits for iOS 6 along
with the kits for OS X Mountain Lion.
Read more about the new iOS 6 on MacRumors, TUAW, and Cult of Mac.

Introducing Grove’s New Piece from Beloved Duo Jolby!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Grove is happy to announce our latest Artist Series Bamboo iPhone Case and second collaboration with Portland art duo, Jolby.
Jolby is a design, illustration, and art direction pair composed of
Josh Kenyon and Colby Nichols. Based in Portland, OR, the two have
worked collaboratively since 2005. Their first design with us, Tree Heart, was an instant classic, and their playful Ride the Weird&nbsp;is sure to please.
Jolby’s
work has been shown in galleries worldwide, and the two enjoy
interacting with various communities through talks and workshops. Recent
local exhibitions include Shapes &amp; Smiles: Portland at Albina Press, the Small exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Craft, and the Triforce Tribute Art Show
at Land Gallary. Commercially, Jolby has produced award-winning designs
for an impressive client list, including Disney, Intel, T-Mobile,
Pitchfork, and AIGA. Their creations have been featured by Dwell, HOW,
Drawn, and Juxtapoz, among others.
Jolby’s work can be explored on JolbyandFriends.com and pieces are available for purchase on Etsy. Grove is offering Ride the Weird&nbsp;at $20 off this week only!

Grove Growth: Laser Shop Expands!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
It’s
still a work in progress, but Grove has expanded its laser shop space
over the course of two consecutive weekends, two coats of floor paint,
demolition of a couple walls, and clearing out endless piles of debris.
&nbsp;We previously had to navigate around a maze of tall tables, computers,
sewing machines in the break lounge, and all the bustling people
upstairs working on customer service, website design, sewing,
production, packaging, and shipping. &nbsp;Needless to say, it’s a rather
strange but welcome change for those with bruised hips caused from
“close encounters of the crashing kind.” &nbsp;
A special thank you to&nbsp;Craig Holmes&nbsp;who moved out of the neighboring studio so we could expand our space. This space was his home away from home for 16 years prior to his move to to his new studio on the third floor.&nbsp;All of us appreciate your sacrifice! &nbsp;
Watch Ken, Joe, and Scott as they work on tearing down the walls:&nbsp;

Meet Ellie, Grove&#39;s Stellar Production Manager!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
This
week we’d like to introduce Ellie -- another integral member of Team
Grove! As the dependable production manager in the nucleus of the Laser
shop she makes sure that all of our handmade products are of stellar quality before we ship them out.
She
hails from Beaverton, OR and graduated with a BFA in Graphic
Illustration from the Academy of Art University of San Francisco. This
lady can draw! Originally she planned on illustrating children’s books
and doing character design for video games. Fortunately for us she chose
to work at Grove.
Like
any true Oregonian Ellie loves the great outdoors. Camping, hiking,
golfing, and now snowboarding... she does it all with gusto. She is a
dedicated sleeper and a devotee of tasty foods. (A current favorite is
ban xeo, a Vietnamese crepe dish.) When it comes to cooking she’s
modest, but along with Wendy she made the Grove squad a
ridiculously-good-tasting Korean barbecue bibbimbop lunch (Assorted
veggies, marinated meats and sweetened red peppers. &nbsp;Mmmm...)
One
of her favorite parts of working at Grove is problem solving. That
means: working with deadlines, managing a team of people, and keeping it
all organized. &nbsp;Ellie said she takes pride in how much work we put into
each and every product and that “we do handmade for real”. Yes we do!

Introducing New SkateBacks for the iPhone!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Grove is head over heels for our newest product, and we hope you will be too! We’re happy to introduce SkateBacks for iPhone 4 and 4s! This is a special collaboration between us and our good friend Lindsay Holmes of MapleXO!
With Lindsay’s help, we’re recycling the waste material from
skateboards to create 100% post-industrial awesomeness. Each week,
enough waste material is discarded from one skateboard factory to fill a
city bus, so we’re joining Lindsay in making good use of it. &nbsp;Our
SkateBacks&nbsp;are available now for $49.00 a piece,&nbsp;and we’re also giving away 3 SkateBacks in the final week of the Grove Giveaway! Click here to enter.&nbsp;
At
approximately 1/16 of an inch thick, SkateBacks protect the back of the
phone from bumps and scratches while combining sleek Apple design and
rad skateboard mojo. “Unique” is not enough to describe these bad boys.
Our SkateBacks are made here at our workshop in Portland, OR, with a
combination of high-tech machinery and good old-fashioned handiwork. You
can choose from three general color schemes, Calm, Neutral, or Vibrant,
but each SkateBack is as individual as a snowflake - no two are exactly
alike!
Where Do We Get Our Material?
The SkateBack makes a short journey from raw skateboard waste at skateboard factory&nbsp;PS Stix,
to eye-catching ply with Lindsay at Maple XO, to cell phone accessory
at Grove. PS Stix owner Paul Schmitt, of Costa Mesa, CA, has been
designing and producing skateboards known globally for durability and
performance for nearly three decades. Learning to skate soon after
learning to walk, he knows skateboards well. PS Stix makes more than
4,000 skateboards a day, 200 per hour, almost three per minute!&nbsp;
About Lindsay Holmes and Maple XO!
Saving skateboards from landfills since 2005, Lindsay Holmes of MapleXO
makes recycled skateboard jewelry and other rad upcycled accessories.
Her beautiful work allows her to give old boards new life and contribute
to the community by reducing the environmental footprint of
skateboarding.
And, don't forget to enter our final Grove Giveaway&nbsp;for your chance to win one of these awesome SkateBacks!

Grove-sters! We are super excited that our Wool Felt Sleeves have been featured on Design Milk, the go-to website for design geeks and experts!
Jaime, the founder and Executive Editor of Design Milk, kindly recognizes that Grove is a company that stays intentional about design and quality, from the bamboo iPhone case to the new iPad Cases and Sleeves. &nbsp;She touches upon the unique detailing that the Grove team meticulously crafts by hand onto each Wool Felt Sleeve, most noticeably the “avisible and exaggerated zig-zag stitch”.

the Sleeve is compatible with all iPad generations, and can even
accommodate the Apple Smart Cover (tip: insert the “spine,” where the
hinge is, first). Jaime also doesn’t forget to mention that the Sleeve
has an invisible magnetic flap closure, keeping the iPad safe and secure
when carried. &nbsp;Yes, folks, the iPad has a new best friend!
Thanks, Jaime, and Design Milk, we are grateful, and appreciate the support you’ve shown us.
Grove on!

Grove’s Newest Artist Collaboration: Tasha Chapman
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We’re so excited to announce our newest artist collaboration with Tasha Chapman! Tasha, a.k.a. Jewelwing,
is a full-time artist and illustrator and a lover of the sea. Living
and creating near the beach, Tasha is drawn to animals, nature, and
anything alluding to the ocean. When Tasha’s not making art, she’s
likely surfing on, diving into, or gazing at the water. She’s always
been fascinated by the shapes and textures of the natural world and the
creatures inhabiting it.
Favorite
mediums include pen and ink and watercolor; although, Tasha also
produces a lot of digital work. Personality and a handmade feel shine
through in all her projects. Her designs have been sold at Urban
Outfitters, Threadless, shirt.woot, Society6, and Goodjoe, among others.
The Atlantic Ocean is Tasha’s new Etsy store for all things sea-inspired. The best way to learn about her and her work is to explore her website, jewelwing.com.
Tasha’s beautiful “Feathers” is featured on our bamboo iPhone case and leather back. We’re offering the “Feathers” bamboo iPhone case at $20 off this week!

Top 5 Things to do in Portlandia this Summer!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Among the myriad of ways to enjoy a leisurely summer day in Portland, from Edgefield outdoor concerts to wandering around an air conditioned OMSI or Evergreen Aviation Museum exhibit (then jumping into their pool and water slide!), or even taking advantage of $2 Tuesdays at the Oregon Zoo, we've gathered Grove’s top 5 favorites! &nbsp;
5)
For those of us in the rainy Northwest, we try to prolong our time
outdoors as much as possible when the weather is nice and sunny, so what
better way to do that than camping!
&nbsp;Mike embraces all sorts of camping, including car camping, beach
camping, and the more intense “hiking into a forest and setting up camp”
camping. &nbsp;Regardless of the approach, he finds beer is a camping
necessity! More on that later...
4) Tommy enjoys his summers with some old school pizzazz a la Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer - he floats down rivers!
&nbsp;All you need is a large rubber tire, a rope (to tie onto your
partner’s tire or to trail a 6-pack of brewskies - seeing a trend
here?), some sunglasses, and don’t forget your SPF! &nbsp;Tommy’s favorite is
actually a bit South of here - the McKenzie River, it&nbsp;runs
through Eugene, Oregon - home of his alma mater, University of Oregon. A
river float anywhere around these parts are peaceful and beautiful in
the warming PDX Spring and Summer.
3) Joe looks forward to summer bicycling tours with his lady friend. Ooh la la! This year they are taking a few close friends with them up to the San Juan Islands
and perhaps even up to Victoria B.C. They’ll take the train up and then
ride around the islands and explore all the natural beauty and serene
of the upper Pacific Northwest.
2) Oregon’s Brewers Festival
or, as it’s more commonly known, “Brewfest!” (There were more than a
few resounding cheers of agreement to this suggestion from our Grove
team.) 20 styles of handcrafted Beer, sun, fun, and free admission! A
souvenir mug is required to taste the beers for $6, and beer is
purchased with wooden tokens ($1 = one token). Coming to you the last
full weekend of July!&nbsp;
1) And our number one favorite thing to do in Portland on a summer day is just simply being out and about in the sun
(unless you’re Yuji, in which case you’ll be indoors playing video
games all day, like Diablo III). It’s one of life’s simple pleasures
that we never take for granted! Whether you, like Mary, can’t wait to
bike without your rain gear and fenders to avoid splashing water and mud on your back; or, like Kim, will be living at a nearby park (Laurelhurst or Colonel Summers) reading, picnic-ing, bbq-ing, or walking and running; or, like Ken, will be seeking out new secret swimming holes (he wouldn’t reveal his secrets!) to jump off of cliffs in, there are plenty of things to do in the beautiful city we call home! &nbsp;

<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
This
month we are celebrating our love of walking and riding bikes. Many of
us Grovers enjoy a daily commute alternative to driving a car so that we
can arrive fresh and ready to make more handmade goodies for you!
I
asked a small panel of informed Grovers why they choose to walk or ride
a bike to work, and received some great answers. Overall, we do it
because we love to be outdoors. &nbsp;It’s good for our health and great for Momma Gaia.
It can be faster than driving a car, and is economically savvy. As we
collect our thoughts and ride through beautiful neighborhoods, we get
excersize to boot. It helps us appreciate our surroundings. Best of all,
riding a bike can help a person feel free, independent, and self
sufficient.
 Here are our favorite quotes from the inquiry:
“There are street treasures to be found...”
“I bike because I only live a couple miles from work.”
“My steed’s name is Olde Blue.”
“I feel like I am alive when I bike.”&nbsp;
-Anonymous Grovers
Out of the 11 Grove employees who commute daily to work by biking or walking this is how far we travel (in miles).&nbsp;(Note: This is a conservative estimate assuming we go straight from home to work and back, five days a week.)
Collectively we travel:
46.5 miles a day
232.5 miles a week
12,090 miles a year
That’s 12,090 miles of travel every year without pollutants or use of fossil fuels! &nbsp;Wow!
Sean
summed it up by saying, “I like the feeling of getting somewhere by
your own means, using your own power. Like the feeling of the wind on
your face. Like an eagle.” &nbsp;Indeed. goGrove!

Grove’s Newest Artist Collaboration: Cailan Burns
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Ever wake up and feel like you’ve had a bit too much to dream?
Cailan Burns is an illustrator and musician hailing from Adelaide,
Australia, and he feels this way often. Luckily, he’s able to channel
that energy into painting, drawing, and the digital arts. His
works are crafted through a range of mediums, including wood, ink,
canvas, acrylics, watercolor, digital collage, paper collage, and Flash,
Photoshop, and Illustrator composition. Cailan’s inspirations include
children’s books, 1960s psychedelic poster art, Russian and Czech
animation, folk tales, cultural masks and costumes, and Japanese anime
and Yōkai (ghost stories).
“Mothface” by Cailan Burns
We highly recommend exploring Cailan’s work on TooMuchToDream.com;
in his words, it’s “a bit like astral travelling with Dr.Suess.” His
art conjures a psychedelic world of fuzz, flowers, colour, and organic
shapes and forms. His designs “Drum Garden”, “Middle Dream”, and “Follow
That Sound” are now a part of our Artist Series for our iPhone bamboo
case, iPad bamboo case,&nbsp;and bamboo
wall art.
We’re
so proud to work with Cailan and excited to add these pieces to our
series! The “Drum Garden” bamboo iPhone case and the “Middle Dream”
bamboo iPad case will be $20 off this week only!

“I’ve got worms!” A Formal Introduction to Grove’s Production Assistant, Scott
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Quick to laugh and eager to work, Scott spends his days sanding through small mountains of our handmade iPad and iPhone cases. He’s a push-up enthusiast, a cabbage eating king, and Grove’s very own Master of Compost!
One
word that sums up his life pursuit is “modding”. Scott likes to have
fun and make everything unique by adapting whatever it is to fit his
needs. He’s a true embodiment of the D.I.Y. spirit who modifies
everything from electronics to his crazy bike, Jankosaurus Rex. He even
customized a Grove case for a phone that’s not an iPhone! Check out his handiwork below - he made a similar case for his mom for Mother's Day too (sorry folks, these aren't for sale). &nbsp;
Currently,
Scott works as a production assistant, but his proactive nature had
also led to his involvement in other interesting projects around the
shop. For example, he built a compost bin out of old wooden palettes.
“My interest in composting stems from minimizing the waste stream that I
create.” He added that he first learned about composting and worms from
his mom when she was a Girl Scout leader for his older sister’s troop.&nbsp;
Scott and Ken spent a Sunday planting moso bamboo outside the woodshop window, which is the same type of bamboo we use for our iPhone and iPad cases. In its native habitat, this type of timber bamboo can grow over 70 feet tall!
All of these efforts are part of a larger push to transform the urban decay around our building, as people typically treat clean spaces with more respect.
Two years ago, the area to the side of our loading dock was one
enormous blackberry bush which had collected decades of garbage. Today, Scott has put the finishing touches on what is now a much more pleasant space.
Scott
hails from central PA, and has a bachelor degree in entrepreneurship
from Shippensburg University. “My favorite part about working for Grove
is the malleability of both the position and the company.” Adaptation is
how we roll! &nbsp;goGrove!

</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Designer, illustrator, and screen printer, Graham Erwin offers up our newest addition to our Artist Series.
Calling Columbus, Ohio home, Graham works for a custom t-shirt shop by
day as pre-production manager and designer. At night, he explores his
own brand of detail obsessive illustration. His work is heavily
influenced by the screen printing process, and features flat shaping,
fine vector lines, and loads of personal iconography. Time spent in
front of video games as a child inspired Graham's illustrations to have a
quirky geometric quality - instantly recognizable as his own.
Graham’s work has caught the attention of MondoTees in Austin and Gallery1988
in Los Angeles, where he is currently exhibiting several officially
licensed posters paying tribute to a range of pop culture characters.
His work can be explored through his website. Graham’s blog is also updated often, and some of his pieces can be purchased through his Etsy shop.&nbsp;
Grove is incredibly proud to present “Lucky Cat” by Graham Erwin on the iPhone bamboo case and leather back. “Lucky Cat” bamboo iPhone case will be $20 off this week!

Grove Visits Lazerz! at Portland’s Compound Gallery
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Last week the Compound Gallery in downtown Portland opened a group show called Lazerz! -- artwork made by and about the laser. Of course, that’s right up our alley! &nbsp;
We here at Grove were happy to exhibit several laser cut pieces from our wall art series by some of the awesome artists who design images for our hand made iPhone and iPad accessories.
Grove artists featured at the show include Cole Gerst, Christopher
Bettig, Jonny Wan, Ryan Bubnis, Jonathan Calugi, and Amy Ruppel.
Enthusiastic art lovers showed up in droves for the opening night of the exhibition during the monthly First Thursday art openings. Amy Ruppel made quite a splash with this beautiful custom piece made with wenge wood and white wax:
Also among Grove’s favorites was “Tupac Jesus”, made especially for Berto to which he added a 14k gold foil halo!
All of Grove’s limited edition wall art is laser cut and engraved from 1/4” thick bamboo plywood. Check it out here!

Bamboo Madness: Visiting a Local Grove and Reasons We Love this Plant
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
A group of us recently visited the Bamboo Garden Nursery
in North Plains, Oregon to take a tour of the land and bring home some
Moso bamboo for our workshop. Bamboo Garden is 20 acres of both rare and
common bamboos making up the most diverse bamboo collection in the
United States. Just a half-hour ride from Portland, the Nursery cares
for approximately 340 species of bamboo! Check out Joe’s video to see
some of the beautiful acreage, and meet Adam from the Nursery:
Bamboo Garden Nursery specializes in the retail, wholesale, and mail-order markets. Started in 1980, they helped establish the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the American Bamboo Society (ABS).
Ned Jaquith, owner of the Nursery, was elected in 2006 as Vice
President of the ABS and has been awarded Honorary Lifetime Membership.
These guys know their bamboo better than anyone.
We
planted the Moso bamboo next to our loading dock, right outside our
woodshop. This is the same species of bamboo we use to craft our iPhone and iPad cases and our wall art
- it’s going to grow to be about 30 feet tall! &nbsp;Ken and Scott tore out
the blackberry bushes, cleaned up the trash, tilled the soil, mixed it
with mulch and fertilizer, properly trenched, made a mound, and planted
the bamboo. Now we can enjoy the lushness during sunny lunches and let
our bamboo flag fly proudly for our Southeast Portland neighbors to see!
There’s
several reasons we choose to use bamboo versus other types of wood. All
reasons point to bamboo’s superior sustainability factors. Bamboo grows
and spreads quickly - sometimes three to four feet per day - easily
replenishing itself without the need for fertilizers, pesticides, or loads
of water. Since Grove participates in the fast-paced, ever-evolving
technology industry, it only makes sense to use a resource that can keep
up.
When
compared to a similar-sized patch of trees, a bamboo grove can release
about 35% more oxygen into the air. Instead of taking 30 to 50 years to
replant and mature, as tree forests can, bamboo groves can be renewed in
less than seven years! Bamboo can generate 20 times more timber than
the same area of trees, and also &nbsp;prevents erosion as it grows. You can read more about bamboo use in Scientific American.
Ahh! We’re simply crazy for bamboo! But you already knew that.

Chances are if you have one of our handmade iPhone cases that production assistant Lydia has worked her magic on it in one way or another. She’s the ultimate chameleon switching up her skills weekly from hawk-eye quality control to sanding and finessing iPad cases with her nimble fingers.
This energetic free spirit hales from Harvard, Mass, where she enjoyed an idyllic, pastoral childhood with her loving parents and twin sister Margaret. Lydia moved to Portland to attend Lewis and Clark College, where she graduated with a BA in Studio Art. &nbsp;
While she considers herself a painter, she also
creates sculptural objects from pre-existing forms like large driftwood
or old furniture accented with bright colors and whimsical textures. The results of which are handsome and surreal visuals. &nbsp;
Lydia’s
life pursuits include: bread baking, gardening, cooking whole foods,
and an ongoing analysis of the infamous 1990’s series Twin Peaks. Her iPod is like an homage to Bob Dylan that also occasionally plays her other favorites like Can, the Ganglians, and the Psychedelic Furs.

Grove’s Newest Artist Collaboration: Chris Leskovsek
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
“I believe, I see, I shoot, I draw, I love...things...simple things.”
Chris Leskovsek, founder of NadaMeansNothing, is the newest artist collaborating with Grove!
A full-time art director, graphic designer, and photographer, Chris is a native of Santiago, Chile, living and working in
Auckland, New Zealand.&nbsp;
Here in Portland, his work has been featured at Gigantic Gallery in the shows&nbsp;“Two Thumbs Up: Movie Posters” and “El Dia De Los Muertos”, but Chris’ reach as an artist is recognized
internationally. A 2011 Cannes Finalist and collaborator with Ogilvy, EMI, Hurley International, Warner Music, Euro RSCG, and
many others, Chris has also
been shown in the Kentucky Museum of Arts &amp; Crafts and the Mira Que
Lindas album cover exhibition, among other international projects. His
abstract illustrations, often employing a singular eye, hand, or human
silhouette as a focal point, evoke both a vintage feel and that of
peeking into an otherworldly dimension.
Chris’
ethereal illustration “See Through” is now available as a Grove&nbsp;Bamboo&nbsp;iPhone Case.

Eat, Drink, and be Team Grove!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We
wanted to share one of our fun traditions here at Grove! Once a month,
we have a barbeque for lunch, prepared and cooked by a member (or two)
of our team. It’s a great way to feast, relax, bond, and nourish
ourselves for the rest of the workday. That’s us in the photo below,
chowing down on the loading dock right outside our woodshop.
Despite
the raging appetites of some of our growing boys in the shop, there’s
always plenty to go around and mouthwatering options for our
team-members with dietary restrictions. We cook outside on the grill on
our loading dock, rain or shine, but are definitely not limited to the
typical burgers and hotdogs. Last month, Ariella made lamb meatballs and
falafel complete with pitas, homemade hummus, all the fixins, and even a
chocolate wafer cake for dessert. The previous month, Schultzy and Sean
prepared tacos with soft corn tortilla shells made from scratch. At our
next BBQ, Wendy, Ellie, and San are going to prepare a Korean BBQ
extravaganza that will go down in history.
Our
BBQ tradition started with our beloved Charlie, our former Production
Assistant by day and talented chef by night (check his grill skills out
in the photo below!). Charlie has since moved on to sunny SoCal, while
we’re stuck here trying to top his legendary Grove BBQs of days past.&nbsp;
We
rotate “chefs” each month for shopping, prep, and outdoor cooking, and
the whole team helps out by lining up all civil-like and chanting things
like “meat, meat, where’s the meat!?!”. We all like to do our part; it
often takes the whole crew to prevent Barrett, our CNC machine master and unofficial
competitive eater, from eating himself into an afternoon food coma.
All kidding aside, it’s really amazing to work with a tight-knit group and a company that cares for its employees. Go Grove!&nbsp;

Meet Lauren, Grove’s Talented New Production Assistant
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Team
Grove is growing! Meet our new Production Assistant and photographer,
Lauren. She’s already been busy working with the shipping crew and
rubbing oil into your iPhone cases. At the moment, she’s focused on product photography, like the Leather Back and Wool Felt iPad Cases, for our website.
A
native of sunny, southern California, Lauren moved to Portland last
August. She graduated from Kenyon College with a degree in English and
Art, and a concentration in photography. In her past life, she worked
at a “nerd camp” in Los Angeles, teaching physics and math to highly
gifted youngsters from around the world.
Here are some fun facts about Lauren:
She
currently lives in a co-op with seven people, six chickens, five
rabbits, and two spiders named Stephanie and Onion, the guardian of the
onion basket. &nbsp;
Running, writing, and photography are some of her favorite hobbies, and she also plays the piano and loves to travel. &nbsp;
Her favorite destinations thus far are China, Vietnam, Slovenia, and Ghana.&nbsp;
Lauren
recently crocheted her first hat with orange and white yarn, and just
painted her whole house, left handed, even though she’s a righty. &nbsp;
We’re so happy to have her on board! Check out Lauren’s daily commute to work:&nbsp;
Go Grove!

About &#34;About Team Grove&#34;!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
We finally updated our About page!
OH BOY! We’ve been waiting for a spare moment (several moments
actually) to properly introduce our team and tell the Grove Story. Our
enthusiasm for this new page is hard to match; we were embarrassed at
how long it’s gone without being updated. Now we’re showcasing each and
every one of our team members - the whole shebang!&nbsp;
The new About page is our co-founder Ken’s baby; he spearheaded the concept, and wrote the Story and bios with Schultzy.
Yuji built the page in Django, and Max designed it to match the new,
more organic look we’re striving towards with our whole website
redesign. We wanted the About page to be easy to update and super fun to
read and look at. The Grove Story is also an important feature of the
page, because we are passionate about our company and take pride in what
we do.
C’mon,
everyone loves to look at pretty pictures and mouthwatering
illustrations, and you know you want to read through each and every one
of those truly informative bios... maybe even click on some of our team
members’ personal websites. Grove bios are the new Pinterest. Eeeeeeeee!

Arty Johnstone: iPhone Sander, Innovator, Drawing Extraordinaire!
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Here
at Grove, we like to keep a positive and creative atmosphere in our
Workshop. Hard work is often balanced with birthday celebrations, tasty
employee-cooked meals, and good conversation. One such innovator is
Arty Johnstone, an iPhone bezel-sanding champion who also
happens to be a prolific artist. Currently, he’s working on a series of
life drawings in our wood shop.
A
recent Reed College graduate, Arty fills sketchbooks with images of
people and their environments. Here at the Grove Workshop, that often
translates into beautiful line drawings of our team sanding iPhone cases or one of our CNC machines precisely carving out bamboo cases
for iPads - all rendered in ink or colored pencil. &nbsp;
Arty
finds time to draw during lunch and midday breaks, sketching during the
quiet times of the day. &nbsp;“I like to catch people unaware, when they’re
settled and their guard is down,” he says. “No facade. That way, I can
capture the personality of my subject.”
&nbsp;
Arty’s influences include heavyweights like Alice Neel and David Hockney. Check out his Tumblr to see more of his work! Go Grove!

Mac Rumors: New iPad (iPad 3) Loved Despite Heat Issue
</a>
</h4>
<div class="blog-post-excerpt">
Research shows the majority of new iPad (third generation) owners are satisfied with their purchase and have few complaints. A survey by ChangeWave Research found that 98% of the professional and early-adopter crowd were “very satisfied” (82%) or “somewhat satisfied” (16%) with the new iPad. This compares with a 95% general satisfaction rate for the iPad 2 last year.
Problems with the new iPad are few and far between, with price being cited as the biggest issue by 26% of ChangeWave survey respondents. &nbsp;The infamous “heat issue” was only recognized by 11% of respondents, with the majority of users never encountering the problem. Wireless data costs and storage capacity were among other minor complaints.
Consumer Reports, which placed the new iPad at the top of its tablet ratings, described its performance as “superb” and its retina display as “excellent,” applauding its impressive battery life to boot. They wrote the following about the heat issue:
“We also carried out further tests that confirmed the new iPad is warmer in its hottest spots than the iPad 2. But we didn't find those temperatures to be cause for concern (see our post, The new iPad can get very warm, further tests show, but is still safe).”
It makes sense that 51% of U.S. households now own an Apple product! This is a result of CNBC’s All-America Economic Survey.We were super excited to open our iPad 3 the day it arrived at Grove, and it’s been performing as smooth as Christopher Walken ever since!
